This study investigates the impact of subway network expansion on housing price dynamics in the suburbanization process of Beijing. Previous studies have predominantly focused on short-term impacts or isolated cases. In contrast, this study the examines factors influencing housing prices in urban and suburban areas from 2011 to 2021. Using spatial econometric models and panel data, it explores how geographic location, housing attributes, transportation, built environment, and population density affect housing prices. The findings indicate that these factors consistently influenced housing prices across both urban and suburban areas. Specifically, the distance to the city center exhibited a negative relationship with housing prices in urban areas, but this was not observed in suburban areas. Proximity to metro stations, as well as the distance to electric vehicle charging stations and gas stations, significantly increased housing prices in suburban areas, but had little effect in urban areas. Additionally, the availability of high-quality hospitals, financial services, and a higher floor area ratio had a significant impact on housing prices in suburban areas, though the effect was weaker in urban areas.

## 1. Introduction

It is challenging for megacities to accommodate a growing population within limited spaces, leading to problems such as traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and housing shortages. To address these challenges, the concept of suburban transformation has been introduced and implemented, emphasizing urban expansion and decentralization (Muller, 1997). Suburbanization plays a critical role in alleviating congestion, creating new economic hubs, and fostering greater social and economic diversity in suburban areas (Feng & Zhou, 2005). A key component of suburbanization involves the development of the subway, known for its capacity, efficiency, and environmental benefits, can facilitate suburbanization to some extent in megacities (Yin et al., 2021).

Suburbanization involves population and economic shifts from city centers to the outskirts. In the UK, Germany, and the US, this process has been shaped by both spontaneous, preference-based moves by affluent social groups to the suburbs (Bailey & Minton, 2018), facilitated by transport networks, and deliberate top-down planning initiatives, including the development of new towns and satellite cities (Scott, 1997). This trend in China assumes the form of compact cities and transit-oriented development (Shen & Wu, 2020). In most Chinese cities, suburbanization is government-driven and aims to develop new urban areas, as seen in Beijing's Tong Zhou subcenter (Song & Li, 2020). This process includes infrastructure construction, and population and capital redistribution, characterized by land development and housing construction. The government also supports policies and industrial diversification for emerging subcenters.

Currently, urban, geographical, and economic scholars have extensively explored the relationships between suburbanization, metro development, and their impact on housing prices (Dai et al., 2016; Trojanek & Gluszak, 2018; Bae et al., 2003; Sayin, Elburz, & Duran, 2022; Wang, Tan, & Huang, 2024). These studies cover both macro and micro perspectives, examining the interactions between transportation infrastructure and suburban housing markets (Calvo et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2022). At the macro level, researchers have analyzed urban expansion, population distribution, and transportation networks such as metro systems (Devaux et al., 2017). These elements highlight how suburbanization influences urban structure and functionality. On a micro level, studies have investigated residents' decisions when selecting housing in suburban areas, focusing on income, employment prospects, and transportation access (Pan, Deakin, & Shaheen, 2023). While the dynamics of housing price evaluation have been widely researched, with various methodologies such as econometric models (Rong & Jin, 2023; Tian et al., 2021) and geographically-weighted regression (Cao et al., 2019), the interaction between metro network expansion and suburbanization has received less attention, particularly in Beijing.

Suburbanization, driven by metro development, plays a crucial role in reshaping housing prices, with proximity to metro stations influencing property values. However, many studies have predominantly concentrated on the effects of metro line construction on housing prices (Cervero & Duncan, 2002; Wen et al., 2018), without fully exploring the long-term consequences of subway network expansion in suburban areas. This research addresses this gap by utilizing big data sources, such as real-time traffic flows and Points of Interest (POI) data, to analyze the intricate relationships between metro accessibility, local infrastructure, and housing prices. Unlike traditional studies that emphasize static variables like distance from the city center, this study examines dynamic factors, offering fresh insights into the factors driving housing prices in Beijing's urban and suburban areas.

This research longitudinally examines the differentiated impacts of metro expansion on both urban and suburban housing markets at a citywide scale. Using Beijing as a case study, it provides valuable insights into the interplay between transportation infrastructure, urban spatial restructuring, and housing markets. A comparison between urban and suburban areas, especially in terms of housing prices and land use, is vital for a complete understanding of the effects of suburbanization, underscoring the importance of this urban-suburban dichotomy in urban studies. This study offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban planners in future transportation and land-use planning.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 introduces the study area and data sources. The methods used in this study are described in Section 4, while Section 5 presents the results of the study. The final section offers the study conclusions and provides policy implications.

## 2. Literature review

### 2.1. Suburbanization in cities worldwide

Suburbanization, a key aspect of global urbanization, is influenced by economic development, housing policies, transportation infrastructure, and socio-cultural elements (Atkinson & Bridge, 2005; Buzar et al., 2005; Faber, 2020). Rising housing costs in city centers, coupled with limited supply and growing demand, drive lower-income populations toward more affordable suburban areas (Alonso, 1964b; Rose, 1966). This trend extends beyond city centers, leading to increased suburbanization in both low-income and middle-class populations (Lee & Perkins, 2023). Middle-class individuals, in particular, are drawn to suburban areas in search of better living conditions, as urban housing options decline (Davidson, 2007). Furthermore, improvements in transportation infrastructure-such as new roads, railways, and transit system-s-facilitate suburban expansion by enhancing access to urban amenities (Buzar et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2025a, 2025b; Delmelle, 2021).

While suburbanization is a global phenomenon, its drivers and outcomes vary. In cities across Europe and North America, suburbanization is primarily driven by market forces and social factors; however, government policies, such as urban renewal and housing subsidies, play a guiding role (Mieszkowski & Mills, 1993; Bailey & Robertson, 1997; Bailey & Minton, 2018). In Beijing, suburbanization follows a state-led model, characterized by proactive government planning, land reforms, and infrastructure development, which precede market-driven factors. This approach results in faster suburbanization compared to the more decentralized patterns observed elsewhere. However, the relatively low level of marketization in Beijing has led to issues such as persistent "dormitory town" phenomena in certain suburbs, where commercial activities remain underdeveloped for extended periods (Zheng & Kahn, 2013; Zhou, 2018). While both market-driven and state-led suburbanization exhibit similar socio-economic dynamics, such as gentrification in city centers displacing lower-income groups and pushing them to suburban areas, the primary distinction lies in the extent and intensity of state involvement (Davidson, 2007; Hackworth, 2002).

Suburbanization also deepens the socio-economic divide between urban and suburban populations. Disparities in access to services and infrastructure persist, particularly among ethnic minorities. In the U.S., Black populations continue to face significant socio-economic challenges in suburban areas, while other groups, such as Hispanics and Asians, have made progress (Massey & Denton, 1988; Massey & Tannen, 2018). In China, suburbanization has alleviated urban housing pressure but has also led to uneven development, with newly expanded suburban areas struggling to provide adequate public services and social integration (Keil, 2018). While fostering economic growth, suburbanization can also contribute to urban sprawl and environmental fragmentation, thereby exacerbating long-term challenges related to urban justice, social mobility, and sustainability (Buzar et al., 2005; Coulter et al., 2016). Within the suburbs, some neighborhoods undergo gentrification, attracting higher-income residents, while others remain economically stagnant, further intensifying these socio-economic disparities (Hochstenbach & Musterd, 2021). These outcomes are shaped by local government policies, which influence both the form of suburban development and its socio-economic consequences (Atkinson, 2008; Keil, 2018).

### 2.2. Subway network expansion in megacities

Throughout history, numerous theories have explored how transportation corridors shape urban morphology and extend city boundaries. Urban Spatial Structure Theories, including the multiple nuclei model, concentric zone theory, garden city, linear city, etc., offer a foundational perspective by elucidating how transportation networks influence suburbanization. In the multiple nuclei model, transportation hubs foster new suburban centers, driving population and economic shifts. The concentric zone theory posits that transportation expansion, such as highways or subways, extends urban boundaries, enhancing suburban accessibility. The garden city concept relies on efficient transportation to link green spaces with urban cores, promoting suburban living. The linear city model ties urban growth to transportation corridors, guiding suburban expansion along these routes. These theories collectively underscore the pivotal role of transportation in shaping suburban centers and transforming urban structures amid enhanced networks and decentralization dynamics.

In recent years, the rapid expansion of subway networks in mega-cities has had significant effects on urban economies, environmental conditions, and social structures (Cervero & Duncan, 2002; Antipova et al., 2011; Ewing & Cervero, 2010; Zhou et al., 2019; Zhu, Huang, et al., 2022). The transformative effects of subway networks on urban structures are multifaceted. The expansion of subway networks can promote compact, mixed-use developments (Calthorpe, 1993). Closer proximity to metro stations could lead to significant benefits. For instance, it has been found that the proximity of subway networks positively influences land prices, aiding in government land allocation, and resulting in increased land revenue (Han & Wu, 2023). These findings align with the principles of Bid-rent Theory, which posits that proximity to transportation nodes increases land values due to reduced commuting costs and enhanced accessibility (Alonso, 1964a). Econometric studies employing hedonic and spatial models have consistently demonstrated an increase in housing prices near transit lines, particularly along new subway routes (Sayin et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2018). This trend is further corroborated by repeat sales models, which underscore the substantial influence of subway expansion on housing rental prices (Hu, 2017).

Subway network expansion precipitates significant changes in urban spatial structures. This fosters the decentralization of job growth, shifting it from dense urban cores to burgeoning subcenters (Jin & Kim, 2018). This spatial redistribution reflects an urban densification trend, marking a strategic shift toward equitable spatial development. This development model facilitates the dispersion of job opportunities, thereby enhancing accessibility and quality of life across the urban fabric. Additionally, subway expansion can significantly influence commuting patterns, reduce dependency on private vehicles, and contribute to the creation of more walkable, sustainable urban environments (Belzer & Autler, 2002; Calthorpe, 1993; Wu et al., 2023; Wu & Hong, 2017). The integration of subway networks with other forms of public transportation further enhances connectivity, making cities more navigable and inclusive (Orozco et al., 2023). Recent studies have shown that these networks can play a crucial role in shaping urban cultural identity, fostering community development, and revitalizing neglected areas (Liu, Chau, & Bao, 2023).

### 2.3. Suburbanization and housing dynamics

Suburbanization, intertwined with the complexities of urban-rural interactions, mirrors a paradigm shift in which the allure of urban amenities often counterbalances the heightened housing costs in major cities. These amenities, encompassing a range of urban conveniences, are crucial in attracting rural-urban migrants, even amid restrictive household registration systems in megacities that impose additional economic burdens (Song & Zhang, 2020). Moreover, the appeal of suburban living is augmented by efficient transportation infrastructure. This development facilitates accessibility and escalates residential demand and property prices in these areas (Schläpfer et al., 2015). Regarding China's urbanization, which is fundamentally shaped by rapid industrialization, a diverse landscape of suburbanization and property price dynamics exists within its sprawling megacities. A notable research gap exists in the comprehensive examination of the long-term impacts of rail infrastructure in suburban areas, particularly regarding understanding the intricate spatial mechanisms at play (Schläpfer et al., 2015; Shen & Wu, 2020).

Housing prices are shaped by factors such as location desirability, service accessibility, economic conditions, and policy frameworks (Follain & Jimenez, 1985; Li et al., 2022). High-level public service facilities also play a significant role. The presence of top-tier amenities such as hospitals, financial districts, and commercial centers significantly influences housing prices, a phenomenon well documented in urban economics (Gabriel & Wolch, 1984). This is particularly evident in suburban areas where such amenities are less frequent yet highly valued for suburbanites (Liu, Wei, & Wu, 2023). Concurrently, the concept "Not in My Back Yard (NIMBY)" has emerged as a significant factor in suburban areas, specifically regarding new infrastructure developments, such as subway systems (He et al., 2016). This effect underscores the dual nature of infrastructure development, in which proximity to certain facilities may lead to increased property value while evoking local resistance driven by perceived disruptions (Gu, 2016; Xu et al., 2023). These studies emphasize the need to examine hypotheses on how proximity to amenities and transport infrastructure developments variably impact housing prices in urban and suburban contexts.

While subway expansion typically boosts property values, factors like noise, congestion, and an overreliance on transit without supporting infrastructure can offset these benefits, reducing the anticipated advantages of proximity to subway stations. In suburban Washington, DC, where automobile-dependent commuting predominates, proximity to subway stations correlates with lower housing prices, reflecting a preference for living farther from transit hubs in favor of parking and automobile access (Acuña, 2023). Similarly, the complexity of transfer stations, as seen in Beijing, tends to have a more pronounced negative impact on housing prices, especially in suburban areas, due to congestion and operational challenges (Dai et al., 2016). The effects of subway expansion, however, are often mixed and context-dependent. While the announcement or construction of a new subway line may initially increase housing prices due to anticipated benefits, operational negative externalities-such as noise, congestion, and overcrowding-can later lead to price declines, as seen in cities like Seoul (Bae et al., 2003). Moreover, the impact of proximity to subway stations varies with distance; some studies show a price decrease with increasing distance (Trojanek & Gluszak, 2018), while others suggest a positive correlation (Sayin et al., 2022), highlighting the complex interplay between accessibility and disamenities. Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of subway expansion's effect on housing prices is essential.

Considering the multitude of factors affecting housing prices and their interplay in influencing market dynamics and consumer preferences, price elasticity relative to these factors becomes particularly crucial in housing choices. This elasticity demonstrates demand sensitivity to price changes as elucidated by hedonic models that quantify residential attributes (Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2016; Goodman, 1978). However, traditional models often fail to account for spatial dependencies. Recent advances in spatial econometrics, particularly the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), address this gap by incorporating both direct and spatially lagged effects. SDM is particularly effective in capturing spatial dependence in both dependent and independent variables (Anselin, 1988). By incorporating spatially lagged effects, SDM reflects how neighboring properties and broader regional factors influence housing prices (Donner et al., 2016). This ability to account for global spatial dependencies makes SDM an ideal tool for analyzing how amenities, such as infrastructure, shape housing markets across urban and suburban areas (Izón et al., 2016).

Although research is abundant, disparities persist from a mainstream perspective. Megacities grapple with housing demand and land scarcity, often leading to affordability issues (Fitzgerald et al., 2020). Suburbanization trends bridge the housing divide between suburbs and urban centers, notably impacting housing prices (Ball et al., 2014). Metro network development is crucial for shaping suburbanization and housing price dynamics, enhancing connectivity and access to city centers and surrounding areas (Tian et al., 2021). Metro systems reduce traffic congestion and increase suburban appeal (Damm et al., 1980). This development supports urban planning initiatives that reflect government strategies (Capozza, 1973). Cervero and Duncan (2002), Kay et al. (2014), and Zhu, Zhao, and Jiang (2022) highlighted the evolving dynamics of urban and suburban development, particularly through the perspective of transportation infrastructure.

While existing research provides valuable insights, it predominantly focuses on the housing price increases following suburban subway construction, often overlooking the role of station attributes and the interplay of multiple factors influencing housing prices. Furthermore, limited attention has been given to contrasting urban and suburban dynamics under these conditions. This study fills this gap by employing a longitudinal dataset from 2011 to 2021 and spatial econometric models to comprehensively analyze the long-term effects of subway network expansion on housing prices. Specifically, it explores how station attributes and other determinants collectively directly or indirectly shape housing price patterns, accurately identifying the differences between urban and suburban areas. This approach not only enhances our understanding of the mechanisms driving housing prices in Beijing but also provides actionable insights for urban planning and sustainable development. This is imperative for a more comprehensive understanding of these complex and evolving urban phenomena.

## 3. Study area and data

### 3.1. Study area

Beijing is located in northern China and consists of 16 urban districts (Fig. 1). The city's population was 21.843 million as of 2022 and it covers an area of 16, ${410.54}{\mathrm{\;{km}}}^{2}$ (Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, 2023). Prior research revealed differences in housing location choices among suburban residents in Beijing and the role of subway transportation in influencing these choices (Hu, 2017). Simultaneously, some studies have examined the impact of differences in commuting flows or other individual travel patterns between the city center and the suburbs of Beijing (Zhao & Li, 2018), concluding that Beijing transitioned from a single center to a multi-center city (Huang et al., 2019). Therefore, the city serves as an important case study for the complex urbanization process involving subway expansion, suburbanization, and changes in housing prices.

Over the past decade, Beijing has experienced a significant increase in suburban expansion, with population and economic activities gradually shifting from the city center toward urban peripheries or suburbs. The Beijing government implemented a series of policies focused on curbing population growth in central areas, such as industrial relocation and non-capital function dispersal, residential registration restrictions, demolition and urban renewal of aging neighborhoods in the central districts, and housing and leasing policies. Data from the past decade help identify disparities in urban development and housing price fluctuations in different regions. Accordingly, we utilized a dataset from Beijing between 2011 and 2021 as the research timeframe to facilitate a deeper understanding of urban development, transportation, population dynamics, housing prices, and their interconnections during the suburbanization phase of a mega-city.

### 3.2. Data sources and processing

Community data spans from 2011 to 2021, a critical decade capturing significant urban transformations in Beijing. This study especially delineates Beijing's urban area (within the Fifth Ring Road) and its suburban regions (outside the Fifth Ring Road). This demarcation is pivotal for comprehending the distinct housing dynamics in these zones, with suburban areas experiencing different developmental trends and functional positioning compared to more established urban regions. The choice of 2011-2021 as the study period was deliberate, since it encapsulated a phase of rapid urbanization and infrastructural development in Beijing, especially in suburban areas, after the 2008 Olympics. This period witnessed substantial shifts in housing price trends influenced by both policy changes and evolving demographic patterns, making it an ideal window to analyze the impacts of these transformations.

Data on housing transactions were sourced from prominent online platforms, such as Lianjia and Anjuke (https://Beijing.anjuke.com/sale/# and https://bj.lianjia.com/).Compared with Zoopla in the UK and Zillow in the US, these platforms offer detailed information on properties, including names, transaction time, price, and location. Additionally, this data source provides comprehensive housing attributes, such as floor level, total floors, housing type, floor area, orientation, building structure, and construction year, enabling a more detailed analysis of property characteristics. Initially, we gathered 1,102,178 records from websites. After eliminating entries with missing details(144,697 records),we harmonized the data for communities with identical names within the same business district. This step is crucial for computing the annual average unit price (in 10,000 RMB per square meter) and the characteristics of each community. To further refine our dataset, we selected communities with continuous transaction records from 2011 to 2021, leading to the elimination of an additional 609 records. Communities lacking data for specific years were excluded. This screening ensured that each community in our study had one data point per year, thus providing a balanced and comprehensive overview of housing trends. The final dataset, which was converted to the WGS84 geographic coordinate system from Baidu Maps' unique BD09 system, included 26,829 records (2439 sample points) organized into a GIS database. This approach to data selection and the specific timeframe chosen offered a robust foundation for our analysis.

We utilize housing attributes, transportation, surrounding infrastructure, and population data that align with the transaction year of each housing price, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of housing price dynamics in Beijing's urban and suburban areas. The metro passenger flow data used in this study are provided by the Beijing Metro Operation Company, ensuring accurate and authoritative data. Additionally, the metro construction data has been verified through the authors' field investigations to confirm its accuracy. The road network data is sourced from OpenStreetMap and has been manually corrected by the authors to ensure alignment with real-world conditions. Similarly, we collected Points of Interest (POI) facility sample-point data from 2011 to 2021, sourced from Amap, which includes the locations of key transportation infrastructure such as charging stations, gas stations, parking lots, and bus stops, as well as facilities related to dining, entertainment, green spaces, parks, healthcare, and education. Given the significant impact of high-quality school districts on housing prices in China, we examined whether the sample communities fall within the catchment areas of high-quality primary schools in Beijing. Although the "key primary schools" category was abolished in Beijing for fairness, parents can still find historical lists of top schools based on educational indicators on the network (Pendall et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024). We identified these schools using lists from popular primary school social networking platforms. To match high-quality schools with attendance zones, we collected admission brochures from 11 schools and linked them precisely to the eligible communities.

To study the spatial and geographical differences, we generated a 1 $\times  1$ square kilometer grid to analyze the differences in facility services across different locations. Residential areas are designed around a 15- minute community life circle, with a high-density slow-walking network composed of urban roads, greenways, streets, public passages, etc.,aiming for full coverage of bus stops at $1\mathrm{\;{km}}$ intervals (Ministry of Natural Resources of China, 2021). Therefore, a square kilometer is an appropriate scale. Furthermore, subway line and station data were obtained from the Beijing subway website (https://www.bjsubway.com/) and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) platform after processing. Overall, the data includes 2439 community complex sample points, 462 metro stations, and 25 subway lines. As shown in Fig. 1, there are overlapping spaces between the subway network, circular road network, and residential complex sample points. Generally, the spatial distribution of residential complex samples in central urban areas aligned with the direction of the extension of the subway network.

## 4. Research methods

### 4.1. Variable selection

The intrinsic indicators used were 12 transportation factors, 9 housing attributes, 15 built environment characteristics, 6 geographic location characteristics, population density, and selling time data (see Table 1 and Table 2). These findings are based on previous studies that show a positive relationship with housing prices (McMillen & McDonald, 2004; Su et al., 2021). The specific indicators are as follows.

#### 4.1.1. Transportation factors

The utilization of urban space is closely linked to the opportunity cost associated with transportation location, particularly its accessibility (Seo & Nam, 2019), which measures the convenience of reaching various destinations within the vicinity of a station. Passenger flow and modes of transportation can also affect the socio-economic fabric (Zhu, Huang, et al., 2022). After 2010, public transportation accounted for ${56.1}\%$ of all trips in Beijing (excluding pedestrian travel). The modal share of public transportation subways increased from 20.5% in 2010 to 34.5 % in 2021. Additional bus stops and transfer options at metro stations indicate better connectivity, offering more paths for public movement. Road intersections reflect plot size; smaller plots enhance walkability, addressing the "last mile" issue and boosting activity willingness. Consequently, our study incorporates factors such as road density, bus stop count, proximity to metro stations, metro station deployment patterns, the number of years between the opening of the nearest metro station and the housing transaction date, passenger flow at the nearest station, interchange attributes, and car-related infrastructure (including parking lots, gas stations, and charging stations) to construct transportation characteristics.

#### 4.1.2. Housing attributes

Housing features are crucial factors in residential choice (Helbich, 2015). The housing characteristics used in this study included housing floor area, floor level, structure, age, elevator availability, property rights, and type. Specifically, the data for area, age, and floor level were actual variables, while other characteristics, such as whether the property is a commercial housing unit, an affordable housing unit, or a villa, were represented as binary variables to capture their distinct impacts.

#### 4.1.3. Geographic location

Tiananmen Square is usually considered the center of Beijing (Thornton, 2010). Following the first law of geography, proximity to the city center corresponds to a greater influence of urban spatial attributes. In this study, TDS represents the distance from Tiananmen Square, and LR2-LR6 are binary variables indicating whether a residential area is within Beijing's Second to 6th Ring Road. For example, if a community is within the Third Ring Road, LR3 to LR6 will equal 1, while LR2 will be 0 , reflecting the property's location beyond the Second Ring Road but within the Third. This classification uses binary variables to distinguish communities across ring roads while minimizing variance inflation issues.

#### 4.1.4. Built environment

Infrastructure and service facilities support human activities and are fundamental prerequisites for urban development (Sheikh & Van Ameijde, 2022). As suburban metro station areas develop and improve, increased per-capita income has driven a shift toward higher-quality living standards and changed consumption patterns, emphasizing shopping, leisure, and dining. Housing prices within station areas are influenced by functional facility configurations, which reflect the utilization value of urban spaces.

Facilities and environmental characteristics encompass land-use density and diversity. High-density areas provide numerous spaces for human activity that attract socio-economic vitality. However, high-density development may result in noise and discomfort, discouraging residence, consumption, and other activities. Therefore, the presence of static facilities, such as parks, should be considered. Beijing's job distribution has shifted from single to multiple urban centers (Huang et al., 2019). This, coupled with job growth near suburban stations, merges living and working spaces, spurring local demand and urban growth. This study uses varying facility densities (including enterprises, dining, shopping, education, financial institutions, green parks, government offices, entertainment venues, medical facilities, and distances from tertiary hospitals) and 2020 land development indicators (built-up area, building coverage area, and floor area ratio) to represent land use. Additionally, facility densities are determined by the number of Points of Interest (POIs), such as companies and restaurants, located within a 1 ${\mathrm{{km}}}^{2}$ radius of each property. Similarly,land development indicators represent the average characteristics of the surrounding community or neighborhood within a $1{\mathrm{\;{km}}}^{2}$ radius,rather than the specific attributes of the individual property itself.

### 4.2. Spatial econometric model

The methodology of our study is designed to progressively advance our understanding of urban housing markets through a series of models, each building on the insights of preceding models. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of property attributes, spatial interactions, and temporal changes in urban housing markets.

#### 4.2.1. Hedonic Price Model

Hedonic Price Model (HPM) is a widely employed framework for studying urban land and housing prices. It assert that prices are shaped by distinct property features that offer utility to individuals. Rooted in utility theory, HPM relates prices to attribute satisfaction (Monson, 2009). Employing hedonic pricing models helps identify attribute values and price forecasts. Applied extensively in land and housing price research, HPM offers detailed insights into price-influencing relationships and elucidates housing price variability sources.

The classical HPM integrates Lancaster's (1966) preference theory with Rosen's (1974) hedonic market equilibrium model. These theories provide theoretical groundwork from consumer choice and supply-demand standpoints. Typically, studies have employed ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and its extensions (such as semi-log and double-log forms) to estimate attribute coefficients. In line with Rosen (1974), econometric approaches include multiple regression models, which disentangle implicit attribute prices and dissect product feature demand. The functional form of HPM is:

$$
{P}_{i} = \left( {{x}_{1},{x}_{2},\cdots ,{x}_{n}}\right)  \tag{1}
$$

The components of ${P}_{i}$ objectively measured in the sense that all consumers’perceptions or readings of the amount of characteristics(x) embodied in each good are identical, though of course consumers may differ in their subjective valuations of alternative packages (Rosen, 1974).

#### 4.2.2. Spatial Durbin Model

According to the First Law of Geography, everything is related to everything else, but closer things are more closely related than distant things (Tobler, 1970). Following this rule, we should focus on the correlation between fluctuations in housing prices across different areas. First, we examined the spatial dependency of urban housing prices by measuring the global and local Moran's I indices of the observed values in different spatial units. Eq. (1) includes the temporal and spatial lags of the dependent variable, as well as the spatial errors of non-sphericity

## disturbances.

Spatial correlation refers to the interdependence between variables in different spatial locations, where observations in different spatial units exhibit consistency-such as spillover and neighborhood effects that influence other variables in the surrounding areas. Spatial heterogeneity refers to significant differences in variables caused by different spatial locations where observations in different spatial units exhibit uniqueness, such as central-peripheral effects. Spatial characteristics encompass both spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity. The Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) proposed by Anselin (1988) considers spatial lags of explanatory and dependent variables, as well as the joint impact of these variables on the dependent variable. It functions as a general form of spatial lag and spatial error models, providing unbiased coefficient estimates, better capturing spillover effects generated by different observational entities, and enabling the estimation of spatial spillover effects based on panel data. The expression for the SDM is as follows:

<!-- Meanless: 7-->




<!-- Meanless: J. Huang et al. Cities 166 (2025) 106236-->

$$
{P}_{i} = \rho {W}_{i}Y + {X}_{i}\beta  + \delta {W}_{i}X + \varepsilon  \tag{2}
$$

In this equation, $X$ represents the feature variables; ${W}_{i}$ represents the spatial weight matrix for the dependent variable; $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients; $\varepsilon$ represents the error term; WY is a spatial lag vector of sales price of the neighboring observations; ${WX}$ is a matrix of characteristics of neighboring observations; $\rho ,\delta$ ,is unknown scalar spatial lag parameter, which illustrating the respective spatial regression coefficients; and $\varepsilon$ is the idiosyncratic error term.

To examine the spatial dynamics of the variable of interest over time and across different units, we employed a panel regression framework using SDM. It is particularly suited for analyzing data that exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies, allowing for the capture of spillover effects alongside individual and temporal variations. The choice between fixed and random effects is guided by the Hausman test that assesses the appropriateness of the random effects assumption. Our fixed-effects model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity, where individual-specific effects are correlated with independent variables. The model is specified as:

$$
{P}_{i,t} = \rho {W}_{i,t}{P}_{i,t} + {X}_{i,t}\beta  + \delta {W}_{i}^{\prime }{X}_{i,t} + {\lambda }_{t} + {\varepsilon }_{i,t} \tag{3}
$$

where ${P}_{i,t}$ is the dependent variable for unit $i$ at time $t;\rho$ is the coefficient for the spatially lagged dependent variable ${W}_{i,t}$ ,representing the spatial autocorrelation; ${X}_{i,t}$ is a matrix of exogenous variables; ${\lambda }_{t}$ captures time-specific effects.

Before delving into the analysis, it is essential to understand the construction of the spatial weight matrix $W$ . In this study,we use the inverse distance weighting method to construct $W$ . This method offers several advantages, including Sensitivity to Local Variations: The inverse distance weighting technique allows us to capture the influence of nearby observations more accurately than that of observations farther away. Non-assumption of Isotropy: The method does not assume that the spatial relationship is uniform in all directions, making it suitable for urban settings where directional influences may vary. We considered distance-based spatial weights in our analysis.

$$
{W}_{i,j} = 1/\text{ Distance }{}_{i,j}{}^{2} \tag{4}
$$

$$
W = \left( \begin{matrix} {W}_{1,1} & \cdots & {W}_{1,\mathrm{n}} \\  \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\  {W}_{\mathrm{n},1} & \cdots & {W}_{\mathrm{n},\mathrm{n}} \end{matrix}\right)  \tag{5}
$$

${W}_{i,j}$ represents the spatial weights between $i$ and $j$ ; Distanc ${e}_{i,j}$ represents the distance from $i$ to $j;W$ is the spatial weight matrix after standardization and is an $n \times  n$ matrix,where $n$ represents the number of samples.

#### 4.2.3. Spatial econometric analysis

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Beijing's housing market dynamics using a hierarchical regression approach to systematically screen and gradually test each group of variables. This process allowed us to develop a model that achieves a high coefficient of determination $\left( {\mathrm{R}}^{2}\right)$ ,low variance inflation factor(VIF),and representative variables based on key factors influencing housing prices, as summarized in our study. The results are detailed in Table 3.

To enhance clarity and provide a structured understanding of our analyses, we included an analytical framework diagram (Fig. 2) to illustrate how each model contributes to the overall exploration of housing price dynamics. Additionally, we reorganized and consolidated the regression results into Tables 3, 4, and 5, with each table focusing on the housing price determinants within different spatial scopes of Beijing, providing a more concise and focused presentation.

Table 3 presents the foundational analyses using the basic Hedonic Price Model (HPM). This table focuses on the influence of key explanatory variables on housing prices, providing a baseline understanding of the determinants of housing prices. The results in Table 3 are derived from an OLS regression framework and include VIF diagnostics to ensure multicollinearity is controlled. Additionally, spatial error and spatial lag diagnostics, conducted using Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests, are included to ensure the robustness of the foundational models and to substantiate the transition to spatial econometric models.

Table 4 focuses on urban areas and presents the results of Spatial Durbin Models (SDM) tailored to capture spatial effects in densely populated regions. These models account for spatial autocorrelation and the spillover effects of key variables within urban contexts. The table includes the following configurations: (1) The SDM without fixed effects (model-1) to capture spatial dependencies while controlling for randomness across regions. (2) The SDM with time-fixed effects (model- 2), which isolates the influence of temporal variables while accounting for spatial interactions. Table 5 shifts the focus to suburban areas, highlighting spatial and temporal dynamics in less densely populated regions. Similar to Table 4, it also includes (model-1) and (model-2).

For the SDM regression results presented in Tables 4 and 5, we conducted the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test to examine whether the SDM model simplifies into alternative specifications, such as the Spatial Error Model (SEM) or the Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR). The LR test results confirmed that the SDM specification is the most appropriate for capturing the spatial interactions in the data, as it accounts for both spatial error and spatial lag components effectively. SDM allows for both direct effects,captured by the coefficients of the exogenous variables $\beta$ , and indirect effects,represented by the spatial lag coefficients $\left( \rho \right)$ . By estimating these effects, we can distinguish between the impacts of local determinants and the spillover effects from neighboring units. To further assess model selection, we applied the Hausman test to compare the performance of fixed-effects and random-effects SDM models. The Hausman test results indicated a preference for the fixed-effects specification, suggesting that unobserved heterogeneity significantly influences housing price dynamics and that the fixed-effects model provides a more reliable framework for interpreting the results.

By structuring the results into these three tables, we ensure a systematic progression of the analysis: Table 3 provides foundational insights, detailing the influence of key variables like housing attributes, transportation infrastructure, and built environment factors. Table 4 demonstrates how these factors interact spatially in urban areas, emphasizing the unique market dynamics of high-density regions. Table 5 offers a parallel analysis for suburban areas, focusing on how spatial and temporal variations differ from those in urban areas. The division between urban and suburban areas in Tables 4 and 5 is based on the maximization of between-group differences for all independent and dependent variables, determined through the Fisher's test. This organization allows for a concise and coherent presentation of the most critical models, while omitting intermediate and less impactful results.

The results presented in Table 4 and Table 5 provide a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of housing prices across Beijing's urban and suburban areas, offering valuable insights into how factors such as land use, building density, and proximity to metro stations influence housing prices in different spatial contexts. Econometric evaluations, including the Hausman test, LM test, and LR test, confirm the robustness and reliability of the fixed-effects Spatial Durbin Models (SDM), highlighting their effectiveness in capturing both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. This analysis is critical for understanding the differentiated impacts of proximity to urban centers and transport hubs on housing prices across various regions. The coefficient estimates in these models indicate that each unit increase corresponds to a RMB 10,000 change in housing prices, providing a clear and quantitative measure of the magnitude of each factor's influence.

## 5. Results

### 5.1. Transportation factors vs. other influencing factors

The interplay of various factors in determining housing prices in Beijing reveals a complex landscape where transportation factors hold significant sway alongside other influential elements. Within this framework, the attributes of the houses themselves-including the availability of an elevator, use of a steel structure, age of the house, total number of floors, and current floor level, emerge as primary determinants of housing price. These features consistently affect housing prices across different models, suggesting their fundamental role in real estate valuation. In particular, detached villas and policy housing demonstrate a notable positive influence on housing valuations within the research area. Commercial office housing, however, exhibited the opposite trend. When shifting the focus from intrinsic property characteristics to external influences, the role of transportation factors becomes increasingly prominent.

The strategic location of houses relative to transportation-notably proximity to metro stations, accessibility provided by multiple subway lines, and operational duration of the nearest metro station, is decisive in shaping property values. These transportation-related factors are juxtaposed against geographical considerations such as proximity to landmarks (e.g., Tiananmen Square) and the property's placement within Beijing's concentric ring roads and primary urban districts. The proximity to Tiananmen Square, a key historical and political landmark, positively impacts housing prices, highlighting the premium placed on property closer to this central location. Regarding the impact of ring road location on housing prices, LR2 and LR3 demonstrated a positive influence, whereas LR4, LR5, and LR6 exhibited varying degrees of negative impacts. We employed Fisher's combined test to perform regression analyses on properties within and outside the Fourth-, Fifth-, and Sixth-Ring Roads, selecting the Fifth-Ring Road area, which demonstrated the most significant intergroup differences, as the criterion for distinguishing between urban and suburban regions.

In the broader urban context, the built environment also plays a pivotal role. Elements such as population density and selling time contribute to housing price dynamics. The presence of amenities, including medical facilities, restaurants, financial institutions, and shops within a kilometer radius, consistently influences housing values, underscoring the importance of local infrastructure and services. In the context of urban development and housing prices in Beijing, higher building coverage area and built-up area have shown a negative impact on property prices. Conversely, a higher floor area ratio has had a positive influence on Beijing's housing prices, indicating a preference for vertical, high-density development.

Through its robust statistical framework, Table 3 underscores the complex interplay between the factors influencing housing valuation in Beijing. Furthermore, the substantial F-values observed for each model corroborate the critical influence of housing attributes, transportation factors, geographical location, and the built environment on housing price determination, delineating the multifaceted landscape of housing valuation within the city.

### 5.2. Suburban area vs. urban area

Focusing specifically on suburban housing, many housing attributes have a significant impact on pricing. Notably, commercial-office housing tends to lower suburban prices, while policy housing and villas are associated with substantial price premiums (Table 5). Additionally, age, steel structures, and the presence of elevators emerged as consistent predictors of housing price enhancement.

From the perspective of suburban transportation, the time-fixed effects model indicates a nuanced relationship. Notably, while suburban properties appear relatively impervious to their proximity both to the city center and internally-even revealing an inverse correlation-every kilometer of closer to a metro station augments the price by RMB 400 . In contrast, an increase in the number of metro stations within a one-kilometer grid reduces housing prices by RMB 270. However, the indirect effects reveal a more intricate dynamic: although the proximity of metro stations decreases the value of properties directly, the significant positive indirect effects at the 95% confidence level suggest that suburban residents prefer metro access within a community's reach but not immediately adjacent to their properties, possibly due to concerns about noise, congestion, and disruption. The vicinity of amenities such as gas stations and charging stations contributed to a RMB 190 uptick. Interestingly, factors such as station traffic, which may conventionally be deemed pivotal, failed to exhibit significant direct impacts under the time-effect-adjusted fixed-effects model. However, the significance of indirect effects and total effects indicates that metro station openings, station passenger flow, parking availability, and bus stop density collectively exert a positive potential influence on suburban housing prices. These findings suggest that while direct effects may not be immediately apparent, the broader accessibility and connectivity improvements introduced by these transportation and infrastructure elements contribute positively to the attractiveness and value of suburban residential properties. Additionally, with every passing year since the inauguration of the nearest metro station, property values witness an incremental boost of RMB 30, alluding to the broader positive ramifications of metro stations on regional real estate, both pre- and post-construction.

Regarding POI, establishments that predominantly provide financial services, such as banks, have emerged as significant value drivers. Each additional financial service point corresponds to a RMB 40 enhancement in property prices. Furthermore, proximity to tertiary hospitals garners considerable appeal for residents, translating to a RMB 650 price increase for each kilometer closer in Model 12. Economically, regional revenue maintains a pronounced positive correlation with housing values, whereas the per capita income relationship varies. The spatial autoregression coefficient reveals a potent spatial synergy: a RMB 1 increase in neighboring housing prices reciprocates with a RMB 0.321 increase in local housing prices. Finally, the robustness of our analytical framework is accentuated by the model's fitting metrics. For instance, the fixed-effect model (Model-2) capably explains 63.75% of the within-group variance in housing prices by the ${\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ value.

Our regression examination of urban precincts reveals a stark difference in housing valuation dynamics between urban and suburban zones of Beijing (Table 5). Urban locales also place a significant premium on all housing attributes when determining prices, underlining the weight that urban dwellers place on intrinsic housing features. In contrast, the influence of transportation factors and the built environment on housing prices remains ambiguous in these denser regions.

In the urban sector, the height of buildings and the number of floors on which houses are located do not have a significant impact. However, as shown in Table 4 (indirect effects), taller buildings and larger average floor areas in high-density communities negatively spill over to surrounding housing prices, likely due to reduced living comfort and perceived overcrowding, which diminish the appeal of nearby properties. The impact of commercial office housing on prices is stronger in urban areas than in suburban areas. In contrast to the suburbs, policy housing reduces prices in urban areas. Age remained a persistent enhancer of housing prices across both contexts. Key attributes, namely steel structures and elevators, also elevate urban housing values. Certain property categorizations, especially villas, command a premium, as evidenced by coefficients peaking at RMB 11,100 in the fixed-effect model.

Notably, from the transportation factor perspective, only years between the nearest metro station opened and when the housing transaction was made consistently exerts a positive impact on urban housing prices, with a significant correlation showing an increase of RMB 20 for each additional year since a metro station's inauguration. However, due to the highly accessible transportation network in Beijing's urban areas, metro stations also exhibit certain Not In My Backyard effects. The indirect effects results reveal that proximity to elevated metro stations and transfer hubs has a negative spatial spillover effect on surrounding housing prices, likely due to increased noise, congestion, and perceived disruption. In comparison, the empirical analysis indicates that the density of transportation infrastructure-encompassing elements such as petrol stations, bus stops, and metro stations, along with road density, does not significantly enhance urban housing prices.

The metropolitan milieu has yielded a suite of responses to the built environment. Entertainment venues registered a positive impact in the fixed-effect model. This dichotomy accentuates the multifaceted desires of urban occupants, which are distinct from suburban preferences. Notably, the presence of high-quality school districts significantly influences urban housing prices, leading to an increase of RMB 1,940 per square meter-in stark contrast to the insignificant effects observed for general education resources. An interesting finding is the seemingly insignificant impact of proximity to facilities such as tertiary healthcare centers, in the urban setting. This can be attributed to Beijing's urban sprawl, brimming with a multitude of amenities reducing the exclusivity of any single facility.

The magnetism of adjoining properties persists,spotlighted by a $\rho$ value of 0.382 in the fixed-effect model. This suggests the existence of an intricate urban real estate web. Model robustness was validated with ${\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ metrics, with the fixed-effect model (Table 4) explaining an impressive ${57.56}\%$ of the within-group variance in housing price,as indicated by the ${\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ . Additionally,a higher AIC in urban areas compared to suburban regions suggests partially unaccounted spatial or non-spatial heterogeneity affecting urban housing price, indicating profound complexity in the determinants of urban property values.

## 6. Conclusions and discussion

This study investigates the impact of rail transit development on housing prices in Beijing's urban and suburban areas, providing valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers. By analyzing empirical data and synthesizing existing literature, we explore how rail transit infrastructure influences suburban housing valuations through factors such as accessibility, amenity availability, and local resistance (e. g., NIMBY). In the context of China's rapid urbanization and policies like the household registration system, our findings reveal the interplay between market dynamics and proactive investment and planning in driving suburbanization. Theoretically, this research advances urban studies by offering a framework to understand the interaction between accessibility and disamenities in suburban housing markets. Practically, it underscores the need for differentiated investments in transportation infrastructure, housing, and amenities across different regions to address affordability challenges.

For instance, in Beijing, the interplay of accessibility, affordability and disamenities shapes its suburbanization process. Unlike the gentrification trends observed in the US, Beijing's suburbanization aligns with the bid-rent theory (Mieszkowski & Mills, 1993), where land use costs decrease from the city center to the periphery, encouraging outward migration. The extensive subway network accelerates this shift, enhancing connectivity and attracting wealthier residents to suburban areas with modern housing, while also providing more affordable housing options for lower-income populations. Initially driven by government interventions, this development follows a sequence of population influx, transport infrastructure expansion, and the subsequent growth of industries, commerce, and services, highlighting a distinct suburban evolution.

The SDM employed in this study provides a nuanced understanding of the housing valuation dynamics in Beijing's urban and suburban markets. It reveals that proximity to metro stations significantly increases suburban housing prices, whereas a higher density of nearby stations has an inverse effect. Notably, specific housing attributes-such as steel structures, detached villas, floor level, and elevators, are associated with an increase in housing prices in both urban and suburban areas. In contrast, policy housing and housing floor area show an inverse relationship with housing prices. This indicates that suburban residents have a stronger preference for housing quality compared to their urban counterparts.

Moreover, as rail transit improves accessibility, a trend has emerged in which residents of urban cores, while maintaining their employment in the city, demonstrate a preference for suburban living (Zheng & Kahn, 2013). This trend can be explained by the results of this study. The positive indirect and total effects of metro station accessibility on suburban housing prices highlight the role of rail transit in enhancing connectivity and reducing commuting costs. Furthermore, the insignificant impact of local businesses and general hospitals on suburban housing prices, contrasted with the significant influence of tertiary hospitals and financial institutions, along with a negative correlation with population density, suggests that suburban residents value the quiet, spacious environment of suburban areas. At the same time, they depend on efficient transit systems to access high-quality urban amenities and services, striking a balance between suburban living and urban convenience. Therefore, while the metro network has increased suburban property values and accelerated suburbanization, the availability of high-quality amenities remains a critical factor in sustaining suburban development and attracting population inflows.

Our findings underscore several critical aspects: (1) Synchronized Urban-Rural Development: In contrast to Zhu, Zhao, and Jiang (2022), who focused on immediate integrated development strategies, our findings highlight the criticality of a proactive approach to land use around transit lines, considering the time lag between transit development and urban maturity. This extends our current understanding of developmental timelines in urban planning. (2) Optimized station proximity: In contrast to Wen et al. (2018), who found significant benefits in immediate station proximity, our study reveals a nuanced impact, where broader catchment areas, rather than immediate vicinities, benefit more from accessibility. This study offers a refined perspective on the spatial dynamics of suburban growth. (3) Suburban attractiveness: Aligned with Liu, Chau, and Bao (2023), the study underscores the necessity of high-value amenities for sustainable suburban growth. We argue that mere rail-line extensions, as commonly assumed in earlier studies (e.g., Hu, 2017), are insufficient for holistic suburban development, emphasizing the need for attractive urban features to catalyze growth.

The implications of this study are profoundly significant for the future of transit-oriented development, particularly in rapidly urbanizing megacities. First, it reveals the key role of rail transit in reshaping suburban landscapes, necessitating a comprehensive approach that integrates strategic planning, economic foresight, and socio-cultural considerations for sustainable urban-suburban growth. Second, the significant impact of subway expansion on housing prices-particularly in suburban areas, necessitates a precision-targeted urban policy interventions. Third, policymakers should leverage rail transit as both a catalyst for housing market growth and a means to enhance affordable commuting, which requires strategic resource allocation to balance transit development, housing affordability, and socio-economic dynamics. In the context of transit improvements in Beijing's suburbs, it is essential to develop specific financial strategies to address the sensitivity of housing values to these changes. Potential strategies include anti-displacement measures and housing subsidies to ensure that the benefits of urban expansion are equitably distributed. Considering the diverse impacts on different urban and suburban zones, policies must be tailored to address the unique challenges and opportunities in each area. Ultimately, this study underscores the critical need for a holistic approach to urban development in which transportation infrastructure is harmonized with socio-economic objectives to achieve a balanced and resilient city fabric.

However, this study has certain inherent limitations. Given the city's unique socio-economic and developmental fabric, focusing on Beijing's context may not be universally applicable. Since Beijing's population reached 20.18 million in 2011, after which the city began implementing land use controls, the population had increased by only 1.7 million. During this period, key land use indicators (e.g., built-up area, floor area ratio, and building coverage area) within the metro coverage area showed minimal change. As continuous yearly data were unavailable, 2020 data were used, which may introduce some bias in the results. Another limitation is the exclusion of microeconomic variables, such as regional employment rates and industry changes, which could influence housing prices. To improve the model's robustness, future research may explore strategies for optimizing indicator selection and addressing potential multicollinearity, particularly for variables with VIFs between 5 and 10. Additionally, the model primarily focuses on housing listed for sale and may need recalibration to account for other housing attributes, including different types of new, unlisted housing. While our study reflects housing affordability through price trends and examines how access to various amenities (in terms of both distance and availability) affects suburban affordability and equity, it does not fully address the issue that price increases in suburban areas may disproportionately impact lower-income residents. This gap highlights the need for policies that balance growth with equity. Future investigations could delve deeper into the intersections of race, economic disparities, and other socio-cultural variables to offer a more holistic perspective.
