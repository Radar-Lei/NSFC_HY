Given the significant impact of transportation-related carbon emissions on air quality and climate change, understanding the regional dynamics of these emissions is crucial. Despite numerous studies on carbon emissions, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of China's interprovincial transport carbon emission correlation network. Based on China's provincial data from 2007 to 2021, we analyzed the network's basic structural characteristics and categorized it into four significant plates to investigate their interactions. Subsequently, motif analysis is employed to examine the micro-correlation patterns within the network, and the Exponential random graph model (ERGM) is utilized to analyze the network's formation mechanism. Findings reveal that: (1) Provinces with high correlation intensity are predominantly concentrated in the eastern region, such as Shanghai and Beijing. Additionally, provinces in the eastern region assume a central role in the transport carbon emission correlation network, mainly receiving carbon emissions from other provinces. In contrast, the western region primarily emits carbon emissions to other provinces, continuously converging towards the center. (2) The network is segmented into net beneficiary plate, net overflow plate, bidirectional spillover plate, and broker plate, with distinct roles and influences across different years. (3) Bidirectional correlation motif structures emerge as primary influencers within the network, although specific structures impede interregional communication and collaborative emission reduction. (4) Internal network's structural variables, such as mutuality, cyclic triple, and geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner, along with influencing factors including government intervention, urbanization rate, openness, fiscal expenditure on transport, and province adjacency significantly impact the formation of the transport carbon emission correlation network. The above transportation network research provides a theoretical basis for the country to promote low-carbon transportation and improve air quality, and also has important guiding significance for the cross-regional collaborative emission reduction work of provinces.

## 1. Introduction

The transport sector plays a pivotal role in global carbon emissions, representing a significant portion of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (Yu et al., 2023; Lee and Hussain, 2022). Notably, China has experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization in recent decades, resulting in a substantial expansion of transport infrastructure and activity (Lu et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Di et al., 2023). Consequently, carbon emissions from transport have risen sharply, substantially contributing to the nation's overall carbon footprint (Shao et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024). These emissions exhibit regional disparities across China's provinces, with regions characterized by higher industrialization, population density, and economic activity demonstrating correspondingly elevated carbon emissions from transport (Din et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). This non-uniform distribution raises essential environmental and social considerations regarding carbon emissions, including the inter-provincial transfer of transport-related emissions (Duan et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2024). Given China's vast territory and intricate transport networks, comprehending the spatial correlations and interdependencies of carbon emissions within the country is crucial for devising effective strategies to combat climate change. This understanding can provide policymakers and stakeholders with valuable insights to tailor targeted measures for emission reduction and promote sustainable transport practices (Liu and Lin, 2018).

Currently, research on transportation carbon emissions primarily encompasses carbon emission measurement, analysis of influencing factors (Xu et al., 2022), assessment of emission reduction potential (Bai et al., 2023; Di et al., 2024), simulation of emission reduction policy scenarios (H. Wang et al., 2023), evaluation of environmental performance (Wu et al., 2018), and examination of spatial relationships of carbon emissions. Variability in measurement methods arises due to many factors contributing to transportation carbon emissions. Consequently, results derived from different analytic methodologies exhibit significant variance, compromising the accuracy of research findings. This necessitates a deeper exploration into spatial patterns, including aggregation, heterogeneity (Li et al., 2022; Ducruet and Beauguitte, 2014), dependence (Sporkmann et al., 2023), and spatial spillover effects of transport carbon emissions (Ding et al., 2023).

While the standard spatial econometrics model primarily captures relevant aspects of transportation carbon emissions from isolated regional perspectives, the transfer process of carbon emissions across interregional transportation networks proves multidimensional and intricate. Although spatial measurement models investigate regional heterogeneity and spillover effects based on geographical distance factors, they often overlook the critical influence of social network relations. This oversight makes capturing the multidirectional spatial dependence inherent in existing regions challenging. Moreover, significant disparities in economic development (Zhu et al., 2024), policy influence (Lee et al., 2024), factor allocation, and other regional elements result in distinct input and emission directions for assumed transportation carbon emissions, indicative of multidirectional spatial network correlation. Consequently, the conventional analysis framework needs to adequately represent the multidimensional spatial correlation effects of transport carbon emissions from a global perspective, rendering it incapable of elucidating the driving mechanisms behind various carbon emission directions. This deficiency precludes its utility as a scientific and reliable foundation for making informed decisions regarding collaborative emission reduction strategies in an era of heightened carbon emissions.

However, some scholars have recognized the limitations of existing methods and applied social network analysis methods. Huo et al. (2022) employed social network analysis to examine the spatial network of regional carbon emissions within China's construction industry, identifying factors influencing the regional correlation of carbon emissions. On a global scale, the relationships between countries encompass a vast and intricate network, spanning various domains such as trade, finance, politics, scientific and technological cooperation, and population migration. By constructing and analyzing these complex networks, we can uncover crucial information about interdependence, modes of cooperation, and pathways of information transmission between countries (Snyder and Kick, 1979). Studying the global network structure allows identifying key nodes, vulnerabilities, and system resilience, providing a scientific basis for countries to formulate strategies, adjust policies, and respond to global challenges. Wu et al. (2022) employed a multi-regional input-output model and complex network theory to track the transfer of air pollutants from oil refining via international trade. The study revealed a strong correlation between nodes in the global oil refining air pollution logistics network, indicating that emission reduction measures in one node could effectively propagate to other interconnected nodes. This method has been successfully employed to investigate carbon emission flows in the global nickel industrial chain (M. Wang et al., 2023) and the transfer of pollutants through global trade in light industrial products (Zhao et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the study of the network's overall structural characteristics overlooks the internal relationships between nodes, thus failing to elucidate the microscopic correlation model and the specific formation mechanism of the carbon emission correlation network. Currently, most domestic and international studies focus solely on discussing the network's creation mechanism or performing a single microscopic investigation of the network structure (Ma et al., 2023; Lei et al., 2020; Windzio, 2018).

Although previous studies have extensively explored carbon emissions in the transportation sector, they have largely focused on isolated regions or countries without considering the intricate interregional correlations. Additionally, there is a lack of in-depth analysis on the micro-correlation patterns and formation mechanisms within these networks. Therefore, this study uses the relevant information and data from the transportation industry in different regions of China to fill the gap in the study of social network methods and the transportation industry in China. This will provide national policymakers and stake-holders with targeted emission reduction strategies and facilitate the establishment of sustainable, low-carbon transport systems. The innovation and contribution of this paper mainly include the following three aspects: (1) The gravity model was employed for the first time to quantify the carbon emission intensity associated with inter-provincial transportation in China. Subsequently, we constructed correlation networks, analyzed vital indicators, and investigated node interrelationships. (2) The nodes within the network were categorized into four plates, so we explored the roles of different plates and the interconnections between them. Furthermore, key cities leading to significant shifts were identified. (3) We used motif analysis to discover the microscopic correlation patterns within the network. (4) The network's endogenous structure and exogenous variables were integrated into the ERGM model to analyze the transport carbon emission correlation network's driving factors and evolutionary mechanisms.

## 2. Literature review

The social network analysis method is used to make up for the shortcomings of existing research. Social network analysis can reveal intricate relationships and interactions between nodes, allowing for the quantitative assessment of the strength and significance of these connections. Moreover, it facilitates the identification of group and community structures and helps in understanding the patterns of interaction and information dissemination within the system (Hong et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2022). Notably, social network analysis enables the discovery of hidden patterns, which offers novel perspectives for tackling real-world challenges. Complex network analysis provides a valuable framework for investigating interconnected systems, enabling a deeper understanding of the interdependencies and interactions among various entities. By employing this methodology to investigate the transport carbon emissions network, we can comprehensively analyze the spatial correlation and carbon flow between various provinces.

The study of air pollutant transmission holds great importance due to its inherent complexity and dynamic nature (Wu et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). The gas flow process involves intricate interactions and mutual influences among spatial locations. To effectively address this issue, the social network method can be employed to abstract the problem of air pollutant transmission into a network structure comprised of nodes and edges. Here, nodes represent different geographical locations or facilities, while edges symbolize the channels through which air pollutants are transmitted between nodes.

Given the significant geographic distances between countries, estimating pollutant flow transfer quantities might be relatively sensitive. As a result, this approach is primarily applied in studying countries or regions with dense populations. For instance, Xu et al. (2023) utilized complex network analysis to examine PM2.5 concentration and identified factors related to efficiency, ultimately proposing a decoupling model. Their findings revealed the essential role of per capita GDP and environmental expenditure in reducing ${PM2.5}$ concentration. In another study, Liu et al. (2024) established a stable weighted directed network to analyze air quality index data from 27 cities. Through this analysis, they identified vital urban nodes and delineated the community structure for air quality management. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2021) integrated the virtual extraction method with complex network analysis to examine the link relationship between ${\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}$ emissions carried by various industries in different provinces of China. Their findings revealed the transmission network characteristics of ${\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}$ emissions and facilitated the identification of critical emission sectors.

Currently, complex network research primarily focuses on the analysis of network topology, node importance, and overall network characteristics, providing a macroscopic understanding of the network (Gong et al., 2023; Z. Wang et al., 2023). However, some scholars have taken this research further by dividing network structure nodes into clusters based on various criteria. For instance, divisions based on economic development and geographical location have been explored (Zhu et al., 2022). Similarly, divisions based on plate-specific network density and overall network density have also been investigated (Huo et al., 2022; M. Wang et al., 2023). While these studies offer valuable insights into network structure and behavior, there is still a need for more detailed and microscopic analysis. Motifs have been proposed and widely utilized in various fields for over 20 years, but their application in management science still needs to be improved. Motif analysis is an essential tool for comprehending the structure of local networks (Dey et al., 2019). In a study by Lei et al. (2020), the difference in travel time across different transport modes was examined, thereby validating the applicability of modular analysis in public transport. Overall, the research presented in this field has shed light on the macroscopic aspects of social networks. However, further exploration is required to delve into the detailed and microscopic levels of analysis and promote the broader adoption of motif analysis in management science.

The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) analysis method frequently examines spatial correlation networks' evolutionary mechanisms and driving factors (Huo et al., 2022; He et al., 2020; Dong and Li, 2022). However, it is unable to address the issue of endogeneity. The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is recognized as one of the most potent tools in network analysis. It enables the attainment of the highest possible fit between the simulated network and the original observed network through iterative simulation and parameter estimation (S. et al., 2006; Gong et al., 2023; Hunter et al., 2008). This allows multiple interdependencies between observations and eliminates the need to consider common problems in econometric regression models, such as heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and endogeneity, thus making the analysis results more reliable and stable (Xiong et al., 2020; Holland and Leinhardt, 1981; Goodreau, 2007).

This paper combines the above research methods; the provinces will be represented as nodes to construct a complex transport system network, while the traffic links will serve as edges. A macroscopic investigation will uncover the strength of linkages among provinces by analyzing various fundamental indicators of the carbon emission network. Moreover, a regional categorization of provinces based on distinct network characteristics will facilitate an in-depth exploration of collaborative emission reduction dynamics between regions. The internal micro-correlation pattern of the network will be examined, and the model structure will be analyzed to identify the driving factors and evolution mechanism.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 3 describes the research methods and data sources, and Section 4 gives the results and analysis. Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and makes policy recommendations. Section 6 looks forward to the future research direction.

## 3. Methodology and data

### 3.1. Construction of regional carbon emission spatial correlation network

Based on data accuracy and availability, 30 provinces in China were selected as research samples, excluding Tibet, Macao, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Each provincial region was designated as a node in the network, necessitating the construction of a spatial correlation network for regional carbon emissions in China using these 30 nodes. Carbon emissions exhibit a spillover effect, potentially transferring to other areas through air circulation and industrial relocation.

Traditionally, unstructured vector auto-regressive models (Yang et al., 2020) or gravity models (Huo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) have been employed in network analysis to depict interregional interaction among the examined factors. However, the VAR model is too sensitive to variable lag order, resulting in ambiguities in the spatial correlation of variables. In contrast, the gravity model, which considers the overall influence of inter-regional economic and geographical distance, can accurately describe the spatial correlation characteristics of regional carbon emissions. This modification of the gravity model facilitates the acquisition of more precise conclusions (Li et al., 2021; Kuik et al., 2019). Therefore, this paper opts for the revised gravity model to determine the spatial interaction relationship between transport $C{O}_{2}$ in different regions.

The economic growth of a nation often coincides with a surge in greenhouse gas emissions. As the level of economic development improves and the population expands, there is typically a corresponding increase in transport demand (Liu and Xiao, 2021). This heightened demand can result in more significant traffic congestion and an upsurge in the use of transport vehicles, consequently leading to increased carbon emissions from transport. Furthermore, a higher regional GDP often correlates positively with heightened transport activity and the ensuing carbon emissions (Lv et al., 2019). Building upon this premise, this paper presents a gravitational model that delineates the effect of regional carbon emissions, as depicted in Eq. (1).

$$
{Y}_{ij} = \frac{T{C}_{i}}{T{C}_{i} + T{C}_{j}}\frac{\sqrt[3]{{P}_{i}T{C}_{i}{G}_{i}}\sqrt[3]{{P}_{j}T{C}_{j}{G}_{j}}}{{\left( \frac{{d}_{ij}}{{g}_{i} - {g}_{j}}\right) }^{2}}, \tag{1}
$$

where $i$ and $j$ respectively represent $i$ and $j$ provinces, ${Y}_{ij}$ and ${d}_{ij}$ respectively represent the spatial correlation network strength and geographical distance of provincial capitals of $i$ and $j$ provinces (Dong and Li,2022). $P,{TC},G$ ,and $g$ ,respectively represent the total population, transport carbon emissions, regional gross product, and GDP per capita of $i$ and $j$ provinces.

Utilizing Eq. (1),we can calculate the gravity matrix $\left( {{30} \times  {30}}\right)$ , which captures the spatial correlation of carbon emissions from transport. We subsequently determine if the value is greater than or equal to the threshold by calculating the average value of each row in the matrix as the threshold. If it surpasses this threshold, a value of 1 is assigned, denoting the existence of a spatial correlation relationship among the respective provinces. Conversely, a value of 0 designates the absence of any spatial correlation relationship (Huo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). In this study, we construct a directed asymmetric binary adjacency matrix to delineate the correlation network from regional transport in China. Each matrix element signifies the emission relationship between provinces $i$ and $j$ .

### 3.2. Overall network characteristics

Different formulas are used to calculate the global and specific network densities. The most excellent feasible value of the total number of relationships in the global network, assuming it is an undirected network with $N$ actors,is $\frac{N\left( {N - 1}\right) }{2}$ . Suppose the network’s actual number of relationships is $M$ . In that case,the network density can be defined as the ratio of the actual number of relationships to the theoretical maximum number of relationships, $\frac{M}{N\left( {N - 1}\right) /2} = \frac{2M}{N\left( {N - 1}\right) }$ . In the case where the overall network consists of $n$ actors and is represented as a directed graph,the maximum possible number of relationships is $N\left( {N - 1}\right)$ . This paper uses directed networks to describe the spatial correlation of transport carbon emissions, and the network density is calculated using Eq. (2).

$$
D = \frac{M}{N\left( {N - 1}\right) }. \tag{2}
$$

Network correlation degree refers to the connection strength or correlation degree of nodes in the directed network (Z. Wang et al., 2023). The network correlation degree is higher when there are fewer isolated points in the network (Qian et al.,2018). If $V$ is the number of unreachable point pairs in the network and $N$ is the number of nodes in the network, the calculation formula is Eq. (3):

$$
C = 1 - \left\lbrack  \frac{V}{N\left( {N - 1}\right) /2}\right\rbrack  . \tag{3}
$$

The graph's hierarchy shows how approachable each node is from every other node. Let $S$ be the total number of point pairs in the network that can be reached,and let $\max \left( S\right)$ represent the highest number of point pairs that can be reached. The network hierarchy $H$ calculation formula can thus be found in Eq. (4):

$$
H = 1 - \frac{S}{\max \left( S\right) } \tag{4}
$$

When the number of components in the graph is known, network efficiency is the degree to which the graph contains redundant lines. The more stable the spatially correlated network is, the lower its efficiency (Ducruet and Beauguitte,2014). Let $\max \left( L\right)$ be the greatest number of conceivable redundant lines,and let $L$ be the total number of redundant lines. Next, Eq. (5) is used to compute the efficiency:

$$
E = 1 - \frac{L}{\max \left( L\right) } \tag{5}
$$

The level of control exerted by a node over a resource is assessed by calculating intermediate centrality. Specifically, if a node lies on the shortest path between multiple pairs of nodes, it possesses a high betweenness. The extent to which a node within the graph assumes a central position between other pairs of nodes is measured by its intermediary. According to Freeman (1978), a node's degree is often low if it lies between several pairs of nodes. This relatively low-degree point could be at the network's heart and have a significant mediating role. Let us assume that ${g}_{jk}$ represents the shortcuts between point $j$ and point $k$ . ${g}_{jk}\left( i\right)$ expresses how many shortcuts there are between points $j$ and $k$ through the third point $i.{b}_{jk}\left( i\right)$ ,which is equal to the probability that $i$ is on the shortcut between $j$ and $k$ ,is an expression for the capacity of the third point $i$ to regulate the interaction between these two points. Specifically, ${b}_{jk}\left( i\right)  = {g}_{jk}\left( i\right) /{g}_{jk}$ . Add the betweenness of point $i$ corresponding to all the point pairs in the graph together to obtain the absolute intermediate centrality of the point (denoted as ${C}_{ABi}$ ), ${C}_{ABi} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k}^{N}{b}_{jk}\left( i\right)$ . We can also define standardized intermediate centrality or relative betweenness. Only in the case of a star network can the median centrality ${C}_{ABi}$ of the midpoint in the graph reach the following maximum value: ${C}_{\max } = \frac{{N}^{2} - {3N} + 2}{2}$ . Therefore,the relative betweenness $\left( {C}_{RBi}\right)$ of a point is calculated as Eq. (6), and this value can be used to compare the intermediate centrality of points in different network plots.

$$
{C}_{RBi} = \frac{2\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{n}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k}^{n}{b}_{jk}\left( i\right) }{{n}^{2} - {3n} + 2}. \tag{6}
$$

### 3.3. Spatial clustering analysis

##### 3.3.1.The importance of the node in the network: node degree

The goal of point degree centrality is to represent each node's center. The higher value indicates that the node's status and influence within the network center increase with its proximity (Z. Wang et al., 2023). Node degree centrality is divided into node in and out degrees in a directed network. The former refers to the direct relation number obtained by the node, and the latter refers to the direct relation number emitted by the point. The calculation Eq. (7) is as follows. Where Inde ${g}_{i}$ is the inbound degree of province $i$ ,Outde ${g}_{i}$ is the outbound degree of province $i$ ,and ${x}_{ij}$ is the correlation intensity of carbon emission structure of province $i$ to province $j$ ,which is denoted as 1 if there is correlation intensity and 0 if there is no correlation intensity.

$$
{\text{ Indeg }}_{i} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{j = 1}}^{n}{x}_{ji},{\text{ Outdeg }}_{i} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{j = 1}}^{n}{x}_{ij}. \tag{7}
$$

##### 3.3.2.The role and degree of correlation of blocks in the network: block model

The block model analysis comprehensively examines network location models and performs a descriptive algebraic analysis of social roles within the network. It was first proposed by White et al. (1976). Subsequently, scholars have extensively researched and expanded upon this concept from various perspectives. This has led to the emergence of the random block model (Wasserman and Faust, 1994) and the generalized block model (Doreian et al., 2004). Block models have widespread application across scientific communities (Burt, 1978), global economic systems (Snyder and Kick, 1979), organizational problem-solving, and numerous small group studies.

Scholars have proposed several approaches to construct block models, typically encompassing two key steps. The initial step involves partitioning actors, wherein individuals are assigned various positions. Standard methodologies include CONCOR method and hierarchical clustering methods. CONCOR method, which stands for the convergence of iterated correlations, is a methodology that involves the iterative calculation of correlation coefficients between rows or columns of a matrix. This process results in a final correlation coefficient matrix comprised solely of $1\mathrm{\;s}$ and $- 1\mathrm{\;s}$ ,allowing for segmenting items into two categories based on their respective coefficients. The subsequent step involves determining the value of each block according to specific criteria to classify each block as a 1-block or 0-block. In this study, we utilize the average density value of the entire network to represent distinct relationship standards about various properties.

<!-- Meanless: J.-B. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 954 (2024) 176183-->

By implementing the methodologies above, the nodes within the spatial correlation network of transport carbon emissions can be classified into four distinct categories (Z. Wang et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2023). (1) The Net Beneficiary plate exhibits more correlation relations among its internal members but fewer outgoing relations. Additionally, it receives spillover relations from other plates. (2) More incoming relations from other plates characterize the Net Overflow plate than its outgoing relations. In some cases, it may only receive relations without having any outgoing relations. (3) The Bidirectional Spillover plate displays emitting relations to both internal members of the plate and other plates. However, it possesses fewer receiving relations from other plates, achieving a higher proportion of actual internal relations than expected. (4) The brokerage sector has frequent exchanges with other sectors but few relations within the sector. It mainly provides a bridge and intermediary function for the connection between other plates. Table 1 shows the specific plate division standards.

##### 3.3.3.The microscopic correlation mode of nodes in the network: modular structure

The block model analysis mainly reflects the structure-function of the network from the macro level, while the modular structure analysis focuses on describing the local features of the network from the micro level. $Z$ -score (Eq. (8)) and $P$ -value (Eq. (9)) of a motif are measures of its statistical significance for a particular network. The $Z$ -score is computed by dividing the difference between a motifs mean frequency in a large set of randomly generated networks and its frequency in the target network by the standard deviation of the random networks' frequency values (Milo et al., 2002; Maslov et al., 2003). Random versions of the analyzed networks are produced with a local rewiring algorithm that preserves the vertex degrees. In each rewiring step,two edges $\left( {{v}_{1},{v}_{2}}\right)$ and $\left( {{v}_{3},{v}_{4}}\right)$ are rewired in such a way that ${v}_{1}$ becomes connected to ${v}_{4}$ and ${v}_{3}$ to ${v}_{2}$ ,as long as a similar edge does not already exist in the network (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002; Maslov et al., 2003). This rewiring process is repeated multiple times to create an appropriately random network. The probability that a motifs frequency in a randomized network will be equal to or higher than its frequency in the target network is represented by the motifs $P$ -value (Milo et al.,2002; Maslov et al., 2003).

$$
{Z}_{i} = \frac{{C}_{\text{reali }} - {C}_{\text{randi }}^{ - }}{{\sigma }_{\text{randi }}}, \tag{8}
$$

where ${C}_{\text{reali }}$ represents the concentration degree of the actual network neutron graph ${g}_{i}$ ,denoting the proportion of accurate network neutron graphs among all subgraphs. On the other hand, ${C}_{\text{randi }}^{ - }$ denotes the average concentration of ${g}_{i}$ in a random network,which signifies the average percentage of the number of neutron graphs in the random network that corresponds to the same proportion of all subgraphs. Additionally, ${\sigma }_{\text{randi }}$ represents the standard deviation of the average concentration of the neutron graph in a randomly generated network (Ma et al., 2023).

Note: ${N}_{k}$ is the number of nodes in a plate,and $N$ is the number of all nodes in the network.

To establish the statistical significance of subgraph ${g}_{i}$ ,certain conditions need to be met: (1) $Z > 0$ ; (2) The $P$ -value,representing the probability of obtaining an equal or higher occurrence of the subgraph in the randomized network compared to the actual network, should be exceptionally low and meet a predetermined threshold. A smaller $P$ - value indicates a more significant motif within the network. In this study,all motifs exhibit a $P$ -value of $P < {0.01}$ ,determined by comparing them with 1000 randomized networks (Ma et al., 2023).

$$
P\left( {{N}_{\text{randi }} \geq  {N}_{\text{reali }}}\right)  < {0.01}\text{,} \tag{9}
$$

where ${N}_{\text{reali }}$ represents the total number of graph ${g}_{i}$ instances in the real network. Concurrently,in a randomly generated network, ${N}_{\text{randi }}$ denotes the average number of instances of the subgraph ${g}_{i}$ .

### 3.4. Exponential random graph model (ERGM)

Generalized linear models and linear regression are comparable to exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The probability of the complete network is expressed in the general form of the model as a function of terms that represent network features that are thought to deviate from chance expectations (Krivitsky et al., 2011; Krivitsky and Handcock, 2013; Morris et al., 2008). The general form of the model can be expressed as Eq. (10):

$$
{P}_{\theta ,\mathcal{Y}}\left( {Y = y}\right)  = \frac{\exp \left\{  {{\theta }^{T}g\left( y\right) }\right\}  }{k\left( {\theta ,\mathcal{Y}}\right) },y \in  \mathcal{Y}, \tag{10}
$$

where $\theta  \in  \Omega  \subset  {\mathbb{R}}^{q}$ represents the vector of model coefficients,and $\mathrm{g}\left( y\right)$ denotes a $q$ -vector of statistics derived from the adjacency matrix $y$ . The denominator,

$$

### 3.5. Data source

To guarantee data availability and accuracy, this study uses panel data from 2007 to 2021, including 30 Chinese provinces and regions. Tibet, Macau, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were excluded from the analysis due to data unavailability. The data on transportation-related carbon emissions were collected from the China Carbon Accounting Database (https://www.ceads.net.cn) using the IPCC sub-sector emissions accounting method. This method explicitly encompasses 45 production sectors and two residential sectors (Shan et al., 2016; Guan et al., 2021). The remaining data was sourced from Chinese provincial statistical yearbooks (https://data.stats.gov.cn).

## 4. Results and discussions

### 4.1. Correlation intensity analysis of provincial transport carbon emissions

In order to comprehensively analyze the spatial correlation patterns and intensities of interprovincial transport carbon emissions in China, this study investigates the temporal evolution of correlation intensity. Based on the calculations presented in Eq. (1), the ArcGIS software visually depicts the correlation intensity of transport carbon emissions for 2007, 2011, 2016, and 2021. The correlation strength is categorized into seven levels using the natural break grading method, as depicted in Fig. 1. It is observed that only a few provinces exhibit a very high correlation intensity in terms of transport carbon emissions. Given the proximate geographical locations of Beijing and Hebei, these two provinces have a closely intertwined transport network, resulting in a consistently high correlation intensity of carbon emissions.

Moreover, the economically developed areas, including Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, exhibit close correlations with their neighboring provinces. This observation further supports the notion that these areas are pivotal nodes connecting the transport networks between the southern and northern regions. Conversely, the western and northern provinces demonstrate minimal correlation with other regions owing to geographical constraints. Furthermore, from 2007 to 2021, an increase in transport connections in the eastern and central regions can be observed (indicated by the densification of yellow and green lines). This trend signifies an upsurge in interprovincial travel between the eastern and central areas, leading to heightened inter-regional exchanges and consequential carbon emissions.

### 4.2. Spatial correlation network analysis of provincial transport carbon emissions

#### 4.2.1. Overall network analysis

The correlation matrix, derived from the modified gravity model, is utilized to construct a relationship matrix. Subsequently, the correlation matrices of 2007, 2011, 2016, and 2021 are imported into Ucinet 6.0 software to generate spatial correlation-directed network diagrams for transport carbon emissions each year. The size of each node in the diagram indicates the provinces' central degree, calculated using Eq. (6). Furthermore, the network structure is analyzed using the CONCOR part in Ucinet, with a maximum depth of splits set at 2 and convergence criteria of 0.2 (Dong and Li, 2022; He et al., 2020). The resulting network of 30 provincial nodes is segregated into four distinct clusters, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

The analysis reveals a distinct network structure for transport carbon emissions among Chinese provinces. Arrows represent the transfer of carbon emissions among provinces, while two-way arrows denote a mutual exchange of carbon emissions between two provinces. Notably, all provinces are interconnected within the network, implying that each province either emits or receives carbon emissions from at least one other province. Furthermore, the spillover and inflow relationships between provinces and cities could be more symmetrical. The carbon emission structure of each province is influenced by its surrounding provinces. Fig. 2 depicts the prominent betweenness centrality of Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu over the past four years. This highlights these provinces' significant control over other provinces and within the network. Their central positioning within the network results from leveraging their geographic advantages. Additionally, provinces with strong control capabilities, represented by blue and green dots, tend to have more neighboring provinces from which they receive carbon emissions. These regions, driven by robust economies and favorable geographic locations, attract dense populations and economic activities, leading to more carbon emissions. Conversely, transport carbon emissions originating from western regions such as Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Hainan, and Ningxia are primarily transferred to central provinces.

#### 4.2.2. Analysis of network characteristic index

Eqs. (2)-(5) are employed to compute the network density, correlation degree, grade, and efficiency of the spatial correlation network representing transport carbon emissions from 2007 to 2021. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3. Notably, the network correlation degree of inter-provincial carbon emissions remains consistently at 1 across all years. Although this value is not visually depicted in the graph, it signifies the network's robustness. It asserts the existence of a direct or indirect relationship between provinces within the spatial correlation network of carbon emission structures.

The number and density of spatial correlation networks representing carbon emissions from inter-provincial transport in China showed a clear upward trajectory from 2007 to 2014. This pattern indicates a high frequency of traffic between provinces and a close interrelation during this time frame. The peak count reached 185 in 2014, with the network density also peaking at 0.213 during the same year. Subsequently, from 2014 to 2021, a decreasing and fluctuating trend was observed in the transport carbon emissions of Chinese provinces, signifying a gradual reduction in these emissions over the specified period. It is worth noting that the maximum potential relationship between the 30 provinces stands at 870 , whereas the peak traffic volume only reached 185. This disparity indicates significant untapped potential for enhancing interregional traffic. Nevertheless, redundant lines within the network grid hinder the flow of carbon emissions to a certain extent, thereby leading to elevated costs (Jansuwan et al., 2021).

The surge in inter-provincial transport and carbon emissions observed from 2007 to 2014 can be attributed to China's emphasis on economic growth and resource allocation optimization, and this period witnessed an increasing trend towards regional economic integration, necessitating enhanced transport connectivity to facilitate interprovincial trade and business exchanges. Furthermore, extensive investments and policy support from the Chinese government propelled the development of transport infrastructure, notably the expansion of high-speed railways and expressways. These initiatives encouraged provinces to fortify their transport links, effectively catering to the escalating demand for the movement of goods and people.

From 2014 to 2022, the steady infrastructure improvement significantly enhanced transport convenience. The regional economic landscape matured as the economic development of several advanced regions stabilized, leading to shifts in the flow of goods and changing transport requirements. Concurrently, central and western regions progressively bolstered their development capabilities, reducing their reliance on external regions. During this timeframe, the Chinese government escalated efforts to preserve resources and protect the environment, promoting green and low-carbon development while curtailing resource-intensive industries. Consequently, the demand for inter-provincial transport of goods diminished, aligning with the nation's reduced reliance on such industries.

The alteration in network efficiency corresponds to the changes in density and relationship numbers, aligning with the aforementioned analytical findings. A heightened network density from 2007 to 2014 denotes increased inter-provincial traffic frequency and closer interrelations, resulting in elevated logistics costs encompassing fuel, labor, and road expenses. Additionally, this scenario may impede seamless management and coordination within the transport industry, disrupt information flow, and result in irrational resource allocation, consequently diminishing transport efficiency.

Unlike the other three indexes, network hierarchy demonstrates a discernible upward or downward trajectory, displaying a heightened sensitivity to alterations in network structure. During the initial phases of inter-provincial transport connectivity, the advantages of each province were not promptly leveraged due to the common starting point. Consequently, peripheral provinces could not swiftly integrate into the network center (2007-2010). As transport frequency increased, edge regions rapidly transitioned from the periphery to the center, propelled by their geographical and other inherent advantages. This led to the blurring of network class distinctions and increasingly uniform distribution across the overall network, decreasing network hierarchy significantly (2010-2011). Subsequently, as some peripheral provinces gradually assimilated into the center, heightened regional competition ensued, precipitating fluctuations in network hierarchy (2011-2014). Amid prolonged competition, peripheral provinces encountered challenges in re-integrating into the center, resulting in a relatively stable status for each node. Interregional integration intensified, bolstering the resilience of provinces and cities within the network, enabling them to adapt more effectively to external environmental changes and reducing hierarchical volatility, which gradually stabilized (2014-2019). However, this stability proved temporary, as provinces continued gravitating towards the network center after consolidating their position (2019-2021).

### 4.3. Spatial cluster analysis

#### 4.3.1. Division of plates

In order to macroscopically examine the relationship between geographical regions, we computed the network density for four distinct plates. Additionally, based on the overall network density for the current year, if a plate's density surpasses the benchmark value, it signifies that the intra-plate connectivity exceeds that of the network as a whole, denoted as 1 , otherwise 0 . By this criterion, an image matrix corresponding to the plate density matrix can be derived, as depicted in Table 2. This image matrix is then utilized to visualize the interconnections among plates, effectively illustrating the spillover effects and transmission mechanisms of transport carbon emissions between different regions, as shown in Fig. 4. It is readily apparent that nearly every plate experiences some degree of transport carbon emission spillover. Plate 1 consistently receives carbon emissions from other plates, suggesting it may be categorized as a net beneficiary plate. Plate 4 demonstrates a relatively stable spillover relationship with other plates over the past four years. However, plates 2 and 3 exhibit varying spillover dynamics with other regions across different years, precluding straightforward classification.

#### 4.3.2. Determine the type of plates

To elucidate each region's role and correlation patterns within the network in the years 2007, 2011, 2016, and 2021, we utilize CONCOR part to summarize the results and compute the corresponding index values. The number of receiving (send) relationships within a specific region is equivalent to the number of relationships within the four types of regions along the main diagonal. The number of relationships within each column (row) divided by the number of regions outside the target region determines the number of receiving (send) relationships beyond a region. The expected ratio of internal relationships can be calculated as $\frac{{N}_{k} - 1}{N - 1}$ ,where ${N}_{k}$ represents the number of regions within the plate and $N$ represents the total number of regions. By dividing the total number of actual relationships inside and outside the region by the number of actual relationships within the region, one can calculate the ratio of actual internal relationships. Table. 1 outlines the calculated proportion of actual internal relationships and the plate division criteria to determine the internal relationships, the four regions are classified for each year, as presented in Table 3. Furthermore, we utilize the annual intraplate and external spillovers as sample data to generate a chordal graph (Fig. 5) illustrating the correlation with an average value over the four years.

It is evident from Table 3 that the number of relationships within each plate is considerably smaller than the number of relationships between plates, emphasizing that the correlation network is primarily manifested through the interplay between plates. This further indicates a relatively consistent spatial relationship between transport carbon emissions across different regions of China. As illustrated in Fig. 5, plates 1 and 2 exhibit more receiving relationships, suggesting that the length of bond arcs at the receiving end exceeds that at the originating end, preliminarily classifying them as net beneficiary plates. Conversely, plate 4 displays the most extended bond arc length at the emitting end and the shortest at the receiving end, implying a higher emission level and fewer receiving relations, thus categorizing it as a net overflow plate. Plate 3 is tentatively identified as a broker or bidirectional spillover plate with roughly equal arc lengths at both receiving and sending ends.

### 4.4. Explore the role of key cities in the network

##### 4.4.1.The movement of plates in each province

Upon examining the evolution of the spatial distribution of the carbon emission spatial correlation network across different years, as depicted in Table 3, it becomes apparent that the provinces encompassed by the same plate exhibit some degree of variability over time. To accurately capture the changes in each province, we generated a Sankey chart illustrating the plate transitions across 30 provinces, depicted in Fig. 6. The analysis reveals an overall decrease in the representation of the net beneficiary sector, minimal fluctuations in the net overflow and bidirectional spillover sectors, and the introduction of the broker sector in 2016 and 2021.

Upon thoroughly examining the plate types and provincial trends, it becomes evident that the provinces receiving net carbon emissions predominantly comprise industrial hubs such as Beijing, Shandong, and Tianjin, alongside economically prosperous coastal provinces including Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. These regions accommodate substantial industrial production and concentrate large populations, leading to significant transport carbon emissions. Moreover, following the global financial crisis in 2008, the industrial infrastructure in these areas has continued to expand, emerging as a critical driver for the sustained and rapid growth of the national economy. Additionally, certain provinces engage in cross-regional industrial transfers, with industrial enterprises or production facilities relocating processing and production activities to Beijing, Shandong, Tianjin, and other regions, causing these areas to receive carbon emissions from other provinces. Renowned for their advanced manufacturing and high-tech industries, these economically developed regions attract substantial human and material resources. As a result of the transfer of energy and industry, they are focal points for other provinces, subsequently receiving transport-related carbon emissions.

The western regions, such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu, are geographically remote and incur high transport costs. Nevertheless, owing to the region's abundant resources and specific economic development and urbanization constraints, transport-related carbon emissions in these areas are primarily exported to other provinces. These provinces primarily export energy, minerals, and resources to fulfill other regions' energy and raw material demands. Consequently, these provinces have consistently exhibited a net overflow of carbon emissions. Conversely, the northeastern regions, such as Liaoning and Jilin, function as transit points for other provinces. With their ample coal resources and established industrial foundations, transport carbon emissions in the northeastern region comprise local consumption and emissions transferred to other regions. Due to its unique geographical location, the northeastern region serves as a nexus, catering to local requirements while simultaneously facilitating the transfer of resources from other regions. Consequently, this results in the export of transport-related carbon emissions from the region to other provinces, thereby creating a bidirectional spillover of carbon emissions.

Fujian and Guangdong embraced a manufacturing-driven economic paradigm between 2007 and 2011. During this period, China's manufacturing industry experienced significant growth, and the large-scale manufacturing operations in Fujian and Guangdong attracted substantial resources and labor force, resulting in elevated energy consumption levels and carbon emissions. Given their geographical location, convenient transport networks, and unique economic development characteristics, Fujian and Guangdong have emerged as pivotal hubs for logistics, trade, and transport. They are crucial nodes in the transport network, facilitating the transfer of transport-related carbon emissions. Conversely, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan do not share close geographical proximity, thus acting as intermediaries or brokers.

#### 4.4.2. Analysis of carbon emission spillover and reception in each province

To determine the key provinces influencing the variations in transport carbon emissions, this study employs Eq. (7) to calculate relevant indicators and investigates the internal factors contributing to each province's composition and the division of regions based on out-degree and in-degree perspectives, as illustrated in Fig. 7. All provinces' average in-degree and average out-degree separate the plane into four distinct regions, each representing different provincial performances. Notably, dividing provinces into different regions strongly correlates with their position in the plane area. Provinces within the same region tend to be grouped together, although some provinces may lie on regional borders (corresponding to the average) or other areas.

The region I demonstrates high transport carbon emissions outflow and low inflow. For instance, provinces like Qinghai, Ningxia, Guizhou, and Gansu face challenges related to extensive transport and high carbon emissions. However, they possess advantages in resource development and heavy chemical industry and export substantial resource products, necessitating increased logistics and transport activities. Some regions may be rich in natural resources and energy, leading to higher energy product exports. The region II and IV display exceptionally high transport carbon emission input. Provinces such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing, Guangdong, and Zhejiang possess well-developed economic and industrial systems, resulting in significant transport demands. Moreover, these regions benefit from favorable industrial structures and trade modes, enabling them to adopt greener and cleaner approaches to accommodate products and resources from other regions. These areas have extensive transport networks and modern facilities, including highways, railways, and shipping, displaying high transport efficiency. The region III, comprising Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Jilin, and Liaoning, showcases relatively cleaner and greener industrial structures inclined towards exporting clean energy. Simultaneously, the transport process of exported products entails low carbon emissions.

Our analysis of plate types reveals that despite Anhui and Jiangxi consistently falling within plate 4 (net spillovers), their outflow and inflow degrees exhibit marginal disparity, hovering below the average level. This phenomenon could be attributed to their geographic centrality, leading to more intra-province transport connections and fewer inter-province connections, resulting in substantial carbon emissions. Conversely, Chongqing and Fujian demonstrated lower inflow levels in 2007 and 2011. However, they achieved an inflow level surpassing the average in 2016, with further inflow escalation in 2021, indicating intensifying connections with other provinces and an increasing influx of traffic. This trend elucidates the transition of these two provinces, depicted in Fig. 6, from other sectors to intermediary sectors. The evolution of Guangdong into a broker plate may stem from its adaptation to the integration centers of neighboring regions.

#### 4.4.3. Microscopic correlation analysis of transport carbon emission network

In the preceding section, we examined the correlation patterns among plates at a macro level through the block model and explored the role of critical cities within the network. In this section, we focus on identifying the micro-correlation patterns of different regions within the transport carbon emission correlation network using modular structure analysis. To achieve this, we employed Mavisto software to conduct statistical analyses on the modular structures observed in the association network for the years2007,2011,2016,and 2021 . The outcomes of this analysis are presented in Table 4.

After 2007, the Chinese government introduced various policies to facilitate coordinated regional development, including initiatives such as the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. Consequently, there has been a substantial increase in the frequency of modular structures. These policies foster economic collaboration and promote resource sharing among provinces, necessitating closer transport links. Concurrently, population growth, infrastructure expansion, and economic advancements have surged. These factors collectively enhance transport connections between provinces and the intensifying relationship between carbon emissions.

The statistical results for multiple years indicate that the $p$ -values corresponding to the six modal structures, namely GCR, FKX, JQF, F8R, GOX,and F7F,equal 1 or approximate 1,with the corresponding $Z$ - values less than or equal to 0 , indicating the invalidity of these five modal structures. Among them, GCR, FKX, F8R, and F7F exhibit higher frequencies, suggesting that for the microscopic connectivity modes solely characterized by emissions (F7F and FKX with two upper vertex emitting lines), agglomeration (GCR with two upper vertex receiving lines), and connectivity (F8R with both unidirectional upper vertex emitting and receiving lines), more effective correlation patterns can be established in the absence of bidirectional correlation (reciprocity). However, the stability of the connectivity mode needs improvement. Such correlation models prevent resource efficiency from progressing, obstruct interregional cooperation and information sharing, and result in non-collaborative reduction of carbon emissions among regions. Conversely,all other modal structures with minimal $P$ -values and $Z$ - values $> 0$ feature at least one bidirectional line,indicating that the reciprocity correlation model is the standard for all regions' carbon emission correlation patterns.

In the case of motif IMF, it exhibits significant instability across different years. In contrast, the remaining 7 module structures containing bidirectional connections demonstrate relative stability, indicating their essential role in shaping network interrelations. All regions prefer collaborative participation in network activities related to carbon emissions. Agglomeration effects from industrial correlations across multiple regions and industries characterize the spatial correlation model and facilitate dismantling administrative barriers between regions, effectively stimulating the emergence of new spatial carbon emission correlations. The regional integrated association model (K4F) ranks lowest within the network. This is attributed to the development strategy of market segmentation and the transfer of carbon emissions to other areas, primarily for the benefit of the local region, which weakens the incentive for interregional cooperation in carbon reduction. This suggests that only certain areas are affected. Enhanced marketization and the promotion of regional economic complementarity will significantly bolster the reciprocal relationship between regional carbon emissions, strengthening interregional cooperation in carbon regulation and advancing low-carbon transformation.

Note: (1) The upper vertices (i) of each model structure are the main observation objects, and the arrows represent the carbon emission relationship between regions. For example,GCR means that regions $j$ and $k$ emit carbon emissions to region $i$ . (2) Emission: $i \rightarrow  j$ and $i \rightarrow  k$ ; agglomeration: $j \rightarrow  i$ and $k \rightarrow  i$ ; connectivity: $i \rightarrow  j \rightarrow  k$ ; cyclicity: $i \rightarrow  j \rightarrow  k \rightarrow  i$ ; mutuality: $i \leftrightarrow  j$ .

The motifs GCX and F8X demonstrate consistently higher frequencies and are ranked as the most effective module structures. Although there is no direct relationship between the other two regions, a unidirectional or bidirectional connection exists between one region and the other. In other words, when these two modal structures dominate the geographic correlation network, the two regions rely on intermediary regions to indirectly establish the correlation of carbon emissions. Conversely, the network exhibits fewer occurrences of motifs IMF, GDF, GQX, and FMF, suggesting that the broker-type cooperative operating mechanism is more robust than the decentralized one. This indicates that the network's functionality relies more on the divide-and-rule policy implemented by broker regions, leading to the fragmentation of areas with rivalries. Geographical endowments and considerations of economic growth, for instance, influence the requirements for material circulation, industrial chain connections, and resource allocation among different regions. As a result, a correlation is observed between carbon emissions from transportation in each region.

### 4.5. Driving factors of spatial correlation network of transport carbon emissions

#### 4.5.1. Variable selection

As mentioned earlier, the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) enables the simultaneous examination of the influence of endogenous networks, actor attribute variables, and multi-level network structure variables in the external environment on network formation. Therefore, to investigate the formation mechanism, the ERGM model's construction needs to address two key aspects. Firstly, it is crucial to determine the significance of the endogenous network structure and its role in network formation. This entails determining whether the endogenous network structure plays a significant role in shaping the network (Windzio, 2018). Secondly, we need to examine whether actor attributes and environmental factors have external influences on network formation. Drawing on the conclusions of previous studies on ERGM as well as the specific objectives of this study, we have identified the potential driving factors that influence the formation of the transport carbon emission network (Snijders et al., n.d.). Specific introductions are as follows:

Above, we have identified the significant role of network motifs in network structures, confirming that the internal organization process of the network system is a crucial factor in forming a network. Drawing on the experiences of Snijders et al. and Windzio (2018), we introduce the following endogenous network structure variables into ERGM. Edges: This term introduces a network statistic equivalent to the count of edges (non-zero values) in the network. Mutual: In binary ERGMs, mutuality represents the count of actor pairs $i$ and $j$ wherein both $\left( {i \rightarrow  j}\right)$ and $\left( {j \rightarrow  i}\right)$ edges exist. Ctriple: Comparable to the motif GOX in Table 4, cyclic triples contribute one statistic to the model, indicating the count of cyclic triples within the network. Cyclic triples are defined as sets of edges of the form $\left( {i \rightarrow  j}\right) ,\left( {j \rightarrow  k}\right)$ ,and $\left( {k \rightarrow  i}\right)$ . Gwesp: This term adds a statistic equal to the geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner distribution with a decay parameter.

The influence of actor attribute variables on forming the transport carbon emission spatial correlation network can be characterized by sender node attribute influence (nodeicov), receiver node attribute influence (nodeocov), and absolute difference in node attributes (absdiff) (Sparrowe, 2009; N, 2012). A specific attribute of a node region may induce a heightened correlation, leading to a substantial influence on the direction, as indicated by the emission and reception effects (Snijders et al., 2010). Furthermore, given that the formation of spatial correlations involves regions of nodes, mismatch refers to the fact that differences in properties between these regions often significantly impact the forming of a network (Robins et al., 2009). The following variables are selected as actor attribute variables considering available data and relevant literature. All data are from the Office for National Statistics and are brought into the calculation using the average from 2007 to 2021. Government intervention (gi) is equal to the general expenditure of local governments, with a unit of 100 million CNY. It can influence interregional transport carbon emissions by establishing environmental policies, providing incentives, and implementing regulatory controls (Lin and Huang, 2022). Openness (op) equals the total amount of regional imports and exports. Trade openness has a heterogeneous effect on carbon emissions across different countries (Wu et al., 2023). As a result, the influence of transport carbon emissions between densely populated areas can be manifested through the expansion of trade, the promotion of tourism, the reinforcement of transport links, and other channels. The ratio of a region's urban population to its overall population is known as the urbanization rate (ur). The growth of urbanization significantly impacts interregional transport's carbon emissions, the expansion of urban scale, and the rise in urban population (Lee and Zhao, 2023). Local fiscal expenditure on transport (fuc): The increase in fiscal expenditure plays an essential role in the improvement and supervision of the infrastructure of the transportation industry. The network covariates consider the adjacency (D1) state between provinces and construct a matrix of ${30} \times  {30}$ , assigning 1 if two provinces are adjacent and 0 if they are not.

#### 4.5.2. ERGM results

This paper uses the Statnet module of $R$ software to estimate the coefficients by Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (Goodreau et al., 2008; Butts, 2008). The maximum fit between the simulation network and the original observation network is realized through continuous simulation and parameter estimation (Hunter et al., 2008). Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were employed to assess the model's goodness of fit. Goodness-of-Fit Diagnostics (GOF) assesses the goodness-of-fit of exponential family random graph models by computing $p$ -values for geodesic distance, degree, and reachability summaries (Gong et al., 2023). The estimated results are shown in Table 5. Model I, Model II, and Model III represent the results obtained from separate ERGM estimations, incorporating endogenous network, actor attribute, and environment variables, respectively. Model IV, Model V, and Model VI correspond to the estimated results obtained by combining any two variables. Model VII represents the estimated results obtained by including all variables simultaneously. This approach allows for considering the impact of individual factors and the combined influence of multiple variables, ensuring the effectiveness of the coefficients.

Comparing the fitting results of the seven models, it is evident that Models I, II, and III, which incorporate one type of variable, are compared with Models IV, V, and VI, which include any two types of variables. The values of AIC and BIC for these models are higher than those of model 7,which encompasses all three types of variables $(\mathrm{{AIC}} =$ ${461.8},\mathrm{{BIC}} = {542.8})$ . Furthermore,compared with other models,model 7 exhibits minimal changes in the positive and negative signs of regression coefficients, with slight differences in significance. This indicates that the estimated results can be considered adequate, and the model achieves the best-fitting performance under the comprehensive influence of all variables.

Based on the findings of Model I, the statistical coefficient of the geographic adjacency network variable is -0.7047 , demonstrating statistical significance at the 0.01 level. However, in Models V, VI, and VII, the coefficient is positive, indicating that the adjacency between provinces has a significant positive impact on the formation of the transportation network. There is a greater probability of promoting the formation of specific structures between provinces when considering the network's internal structure variables and node attribute variables.

Refer to Model VII, the coefficients of edges, mutual, triple, and guess all demonstrate statistical significance at the 0.1 level, highlighting the pivotal role of these four structures in shaping the network. The positive coefficient of Mutual suggests that cooperative transport relationships between regions can foster bidirectional connections, indicating that independent local emission reduction strategies are ineffective, and inter-regional collaboration in emission reduction proves to be a more impactful approach. Conversely, the negative coefficient of Ctriple implies that the triangular transfer relationship of carbon emissions between regions is not prominent. As provinces export and receive carbon emissions from others, the lack of clear circulation and offset relationships within transport hinders the formation of network connections. Moreover, the positive coefficient of Gwesp characterizes the connections between node pairs sharing familiar neighbors in the network, suggesting a certain degree of social aggregation or agglomeration within the network. This may indicate the presence of standard transport hubs or pivotal transport channels among specific nodes, influencing the diffusion and impact of carbon emissions. Therefore, this triangular closed structure contributes to forming a network.

By analyzing the node attribute variables in Model VII, we can reach the following conclusions:

(1) Nodeicov.gi (0.0008***): The positive coefficient suggests that an increase in government intervention at the sender node's level positively influences tie formation in the transportation network. This could be attributed to provinces with higher government intervention being more proactive in initiating transportation connections with other provinces, possibly due to infrastructure development initiatives, economic policies, or strategic partnerships. Nodeocov.gi $\left( {-{0.00051} *  * }\right)$ : The negative coefficient indicates that an increase in government intervention at the receiver node level negatively affects tie formation in the transportation network. This might suggest that provinces with higher levels of government intervention are less receptive to incoming transportation connections, possibly due to regulatory constraints, limited resources, or competing priorities. Absdiffi.gi (0.00008): The absolute difference in government intervention attributes between sender and receiver nodes does not pass the significance test.

(2) The acceptance and emission effects of openness did not pass the significance test. Absdiff.op (0.00055***) positively affects the formation of transportation network connections. In other words, provinces with larger differences in openness levels are more likely to establish transportation connections. This may reflect the disparities in transportation connections between regions due to varying degrees of openness, which could be related to differences in provincial foreign trade policies and economic characteristics.

(3) Nodeicov.ur (5.974**): The positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the urbanization rate at the sender node's level positively influences tie formation in the transportation network. This suggests that provinces with higher urbanization rates are more likely to initiate transportation connections with other provinces, possibly due to increased economic activity, population density, or infrastructure development associated with urbanization. Nodeocov.ur $\left( {-{5.786} *  * }\right)$ : The negative coefficient suggests that an increase in the urbanization rate at the receiver node level negatively affects tie formation in the transportation network. This might indicate that provinces with higher urbanization rates are less receptive to incoming transportation connections, possibly due to congestion, urban planning constraints, or the prioritization of local infrastructure projects. Absdiff.ur $\left( {{6.194} *  *  * }\right)$ : The significant positive coefficient implies that a greater absolute difference in urbanization rates between sender and receiver nodes increases the likelihood of tie formation. This suggests that transportation connections are more likely to occur between provinces with contrasting levels of urbanization, possibly due to economic disparities, regional development strategies, or demographic patterns.

(4) Nodeicov.fuc $\left( {-{0.00912}^{* * }}\right)$ : The negative coefficient indicates that an increase in financial expenditure on transportation at the sender node's level negatively influences tie formation in the transportation network. This suggests that provinces with higher financial expenditures on transportation are less likely to initiate transportation connections with other provinces, possibly due to existing infrastructure saturation, budget constraints, or priori-tization of other fiscal expenditures. Absdiff.fuc $\left( {-{0.00906}***}\right)$ : The significant negative coefficient implies that a greater absolute difference in financial expenditure on transportation between sender and receiver nodes decreases the likelihood of tie formation. This suggests that transportation connections are less likely to occur between provinces with significant disparities in transportation expenditure, possibly due to unequal access to resources, infrastructure development priorities, or fiscal policies.

##### 4.5.3.GOF test of Model VII

The ability of ERGMs to estimate models from self-centered sampling data and subsequently simulate entire networks that exhibit the observed and represented properties of the original network is one of its significant strengths. To directly assess the performance of the final model on in-model statistics, we select a network statistic not included in the model and utilize the Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) function to compare the observed value of the statistic in the actual network to the distribution of values obtained from simulated networks generated by our model. It is important to note that the GOF function accepts only three ERGM terms as arguments: degree, esp. (edgewise sharing partners), and distance (geodesic distances). Each of these parameters describes an aggregate network distribution. Consequently, as illustrated in Fig. 8, we compared the simulated and actual networks using the GOF analysis. The solid black line represents the statistical characteristics of the original observed network. In contrast, the dashed lines and box plots depict the measurement results of the simulated network within a 95% confidence interval. When the solid black line falls between the dashed lines or within the box plot, it indicates that the model possesses an ideal goodness of fit, and the simulated network effectively explains the structural characteristics of the original observed network. Despite noticeable divergence from the median for specific network indicators in Model VII, the entire set of indicators successfully passes the significance test. The estimated model proves efficient, the selected variables are appropriate, and the overall goodness of fit is high.

## 5. Conclusions and policy implications

### 5.1. Conclusions

Based on the measurement of traffic carbon emission intensity in each province of China, this study constructs the spatial correlation network for each year. It analyses the critical network indicators and investigates the network's fundamental characteristics. The nodes in the network are categorized into four groups based on their intermediate centrality, allowing for an exploration of the roles and interconnections of these groups within the network. The study also identifies the key provinces responsible for plate shifts. Furthermore, this paper introduces motif analysis to elucidate the microscopic correlation patterns within the network. Additionally, the study employs the ERGM model to analyze the driving factors and evolutionary mechanisms of regional transport carbon emissions. Consequently, the following conclusions can be drawn:

First, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other regions exhibit significantly high levels of transport carbon emission intensity, displaying a certain level of correlation with their surrounding areas. Moreover, regions characterized by higher emission intensity are predominantly clustered in the economically advanced areas in the country's eastern and central regions. Conversely, provinces in the western and northern regions exhibit comparatively weaker correlations with other provinces.

Second, a complex network relationship among provinces' carbon emissions is evident. Notably, a mutual correlation exists between emission, reception, and carbon emissions among provinces, with this relationship exhibiting variability over time. Provinces located in the eastern region frequently are recipients of carbon emissions. On the contrary, provinces in the central and western regions are more likely to be the sources of carbon emissions. Analyzing the period from 2007 to 2021, the network density gradually increases and approaches stability. The network efficiency also demonstrates an initial decline followed by an upward trend, although it remains relatively low. These network characteristics underscore the inclination of provinces with less favorable geographical locations to gravitate towards the central region.

Third, the provinces within the four plates assume distinct roles within the overall network over different years. Beijing and Shandong, as consistent members of Plate 1, represent regions that benefit from the transport of carbon emissions, with these provinces serving as gathering hubs for other provinces and receiving carbon emissions from them. Similarly, Plate 3, which comprises the northern region, exhibits many intra-plate members and displays both carbon emission outflow and inflow, consequently classified as a bidirectional spillover plate. Plate 4, which encompasses the central and western regions, demonstrates minimal carbon emission inflow and primarily emits carbon emissions to other regions, making it a net outflow plate. In contrast, Plate 2 has transitioned from a net beneficiary plate to a broker plate, indicating that, while it initially received substantial carbon emissions, it currently emits an increasing amount of carbon emissions to other regions, assuming the role of intermediary provinces in carbon emission transfer, typically Guangdong and Fujian.

Fourth, there has been a significant increase in motif structures in the transport carbon emission correlation network from 2007 to 2021, indicating enhanced inter-provincial economic cooperation, resource sharing, and transport links. However, specific motif structures have become obstacles to regional cooperation, hindering information sharing and collaborative efforts in carbon emission reduction. Conversely, bidirectional relationship motifs have emerged as the prevailing standard across all regions. Specific motif structures have also demonstrated higher effectiveness in establishing indirect carbon emission correlations and facilitating network functions. It is critical to prioritize marketization and the development of regional economic complementarity to fortify regional collaboration on carbon regulation and accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy.

Fifth, in a typical network, the proliferation of edges does not promote the form of a network, as indicated by the analysis of the transportation carbon emission network using the ERGM. Moreover, the triangular loop structure could be more conducive to constructing the network. In contrast, the two-way mutually beneficial relationship and the triangular closed structure are conducive to the construction and stability of the network. Government intervention in various provinces inhibits the formation of the network to a certain extent. At the same time, openness, urbanization rate, local fiscal expenditure on transport, and the randomness of their composition with other variables contribute to the construction of the network.

### 5.2. Policy implications

Based on the conclusions above, adjusting pertinent policies can effectively foster regional low-carbon cooperation, diminish carbon emissions, and propel sustainable development. The execution of these policy measures will yield dual economic and environmental benefits for the region:

(1) Establish carbon emission allowances considering regional economic conditions and emission levels. Adjust the quotas based on factors such as the level of economic development, energy structure, industrial layout, and infrastructure of each region. Introduce cross-regional carbon emission trading markets to provide flexible options for areas to reduce emissions and subsequently decrease traffic flows.

(2) Develop a cross-regional carbon reduction cooperation mechanism to provide technical support, funds, and resources to the western and northern regions. This can include establishing a dedicated fund for low-carbon technology transfer, creating joint research and development programs, and offering tax incentives for companies relocating to low-emission areas. Governments can offer incentives such as subsidies or tax breaks to encourage high-emission regions to relocate critical industries to low-emission areas, thereby reducing carbon emissions from transportation. Regular assessments and adjustments of these incentives can ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.

(3) Establish interregional economic cooperation frameworks to promote collaboration between vital and peripheral regions. This can involve industrial development collaboration, specialization, and resource sharing. Encourage economically developed areas to share technology and expertise with developing regions to accelerate the adoption of carbon reduction technologies and practices.

(4) Support coordination mechanisms among regions that facilitate closed-loop carbon transfer. Promote information sharing and cooperation among areas to strengthen the formation and stability of carbon reduction networks. Establish regional carbon trading platforms to facilitate the exchange of carbon credits and promote market-based approaches to carbon reduction and implement standardized data collection and reporting systems to ensure consistent and accurate tracking of carbon transfer activities across regions.

(5) Encourage the government to promote inter-regional exchanges and cooperation by developing trans-regional transport and infrastructure. Foster technology cooperation and innovation among enterprises to advance the development and application of low-carbon technologies. Allocate funding and provide incentives for the development of green transport corridors and sustainable infrastructure projects that connect different regions and create public-private partnerships to support research and development in low-carbon technologies, providing grants and tax breaks to enterprises that invest in sustainable innovations.

## 6. Future research

Although many studies have utilized social network analysis methods, most have solely focused on analyzing basic network indicators. On the other hand, this paper employs motif analysis and the ERGM to examine the transport carbon emission correlation network, demonstrating the applicability of these methods and laying the groundwork for future research endeavors. In the motif analysis, our study primarily focuses on network structures involving three nodes, and more complex structures can be investigated in subsequent studies. Regarding the ERGM model, the selection of network endogenous structure variables, actor attribute variables, and external environmental factors is constrained by data availability and the accuracy of estimation results. Future studies can incorporate a broader range of variable types into the model for comprehensive analysis. Specifically, researchers can explore economic interdependencies, regional policy differences, and environmental regulations. Additionally, longitudinal studies could investigate how these variables impact the evolution of the transport carbon emission network over time. Incorporating advanced data collection methods, such as remote sensing and big data analytics, could also enhance the accuracy and depth of future analyses.
