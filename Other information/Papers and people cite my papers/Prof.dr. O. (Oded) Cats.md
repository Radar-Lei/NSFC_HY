### Profile

Oded Cats is a professor in the Department of Transport and Planning and a co-leader of the Smart Public Transport Lab. His research interests lie in the intersection between transport networks, operations, policy and travel behaviour, especially in the context of multi-modal metropolitan public transport systems. Oded holds a dual-PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.es (PPTS) course. 

### Research

My main research aim is to develop theories and models of multi-modal passenger transport networks by combining advancements from behavioral sciences, operations research and complex network theory. The domain of application for most of my work is metropolitan public transport systems where I focused on route choice, service optimization, control, network design and robustness, travel information and reliability. Research activities often support public transport agencies and operators’ decision making.

**Research themes:**

-   Planning and Managing Metropolitan Public Transport Networks
-   Reliable Multimodal Transport Systems
-   Tactical and Real-time Optimization of Public Transport Systems
-   Route Choice and Assignment Models
-   Travel Behaviour and Policy Evaluation
-   Active Mode Mobility
