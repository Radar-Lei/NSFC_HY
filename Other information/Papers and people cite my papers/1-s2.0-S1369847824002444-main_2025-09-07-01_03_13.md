Electronic fences are now used to regulate the parking behavior of bike-sharing users, but the issue of improper parking within such fenced areas has not been resolved. Based on the theories of perceived value and perceived risk, this study used online behavioral experiments to simulate a scenario of users parking shared bicycles. By considering three factors - economic incentives, punitive measures, and travel scenarios - this study examined variations in users' willingness to standardize the parking of shared bicycles. Data from 809 valid questionnaires were collected and empirically analyzed using bootstrap and regression analyses. According to the results, both economic incentives and penalties significantly enhanced users' willingness to standardize the parking of shared bicycles, and the impact of penalties was slightly stronger than that of incentives. Perceived value played a mediating role between economic incentives and users' willingness to properly park shared bicycles. Perceived risk acted as a mediator between punitive measures and the regulated parking intention of users. Travel scenarios served as a moderating factor between penalties and users' willingness to park shared bicycles in a compliant manner, with the users' compliance willingness in non-commuting travel scenarios significantly surpassing that in commuting contexts. These findings enrich the knowledge of sustainable usage behaviors among bike-sharing users, providing insights for bike-sharing companies to manage user behavior. Based on these results, several policy recommendations aimed at guiding governments and companies in regulating electronic fences and user parking behaviors are proposed.

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid advancement of mobile Internet technology and the sharing economy, there is an increasing search for greener and more convenient means of travel. Dockless bike-sharing, as a new form of the sharing economy, offers greater convenience and flexibility compared to traditional docked counterparts (Chen et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2023). Compared to traditional public transportation, bike-sharing offers distinct time and cost advantages, occasionally substituting for short-distance buses and metro trips (Yang et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2020). The safety, convenience, and comfort of shared bicycles as a form of urban infrastructure play an important role in the mobility of urban residents. High-quality bicycle infrastructure will encourage more residents to use bicycles for their travel needs (Pucher and Buehler, 2016). For example, the proper planning of bicycle lanes can ensure safer travel. However, during the implementation of such measures, it is also essential to enhance the public acceptance of such sustainable transportation infrastructure (Loyola et al., 2023). Designating bike-sharing parking areas near subway stations and providing shared bicycles in these locations can connect these stations with both remote and high-traffic areas. Such connections with high-frequency transit routes can effectively improve transportation accessibility (Spierenburg et al., 2024). The integration of shared bicycles with the transport network of a city can help to optimize the city's transport network thereby alleviating traffic congestion,and opening up the "last kilometer" of daily travel for urban residents (Huang and Xu, 2023). As a form of aerobic exercise, riding shared bicycles is beneficial to health, emerging as a new choice for healthy commuting among urban residents (Fishman et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2023). Bike-sharing was found to contribute significantly to urban carbon reduction efforts by decreasing the residents' reliance on private vehicles, thereby reducing fuel emissions (Chang et al., 2023). Due to these features, dockless bike-sharing has attracted a large number of users. As of March 2023, the number of dockless shared bikes in China had reached 14.9 million, the total number of registered users of shared bicycles on various platforms reached 1.768 billion (CRTA, 2023). Globally, more than 1,600 cities have already offer bike-sharing services (Dong et al., 2023). Bike-sharing has become an indispensable part of the urban transportation system (Liu et al., 2022).

However, shared bicycles are nowadays mostly "dockless". While this feature provides convenience by permitting users to park shared bicycles anywhere after their use, it has also given rise to an increasingly problematic issue of disorderly parking. Disorderly parking of shared bicycles often leads to congestion around roads and subway entrances, thus disrupting traffic order, accelerating wear and tear on the bicycles, and inconveniencing future users (Shi et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021). The accumulation of disorderly parked shared bicycles substantially inconveniences the retrieval and placement of these bikes, as the movement of a single bicycle can potentially lead to the toppling of many others. According to the broken windows theory, unresolved minor issues can escalate into more severe antisocial behaviors (Liu et al., 2019). In the case of bike sharing, the improper parking of shared bicycles conveys to individuals the notion that such behavior is acceptable. The sight of bicycles parked in an uncontrolled manner at a bike-sharing spot can easily lead to more unregulated parking behavior. Social learning theory posits that humans imitate and replicate the behaviors of others in social interactions (Mesoudi, 2011). Therefore, the issue of whether shared bicycles are parked within the electronic fences and the neatness of their arrangement greatly influence the parking behaviors of subsequent users. Measures taken by companies to encourage users to park shared bicycles properly can thus promote more standardized parking behavior.

To regulate the parking behavior of shared bicycle users, private firms and the government have jointly delineated electronic fences for shared bicycles. Such electronic fences monitor the parking location of shared bikes through GPS positioning and Bluetooth technology. Users can only complete payment and return bikes when parking them within the electronic fence. This approach has somewhat standardized the parking of shared bicycles, but still falls short of what is needed, as many users still park their shared bicycles randomly within the area of the electronic fence. Such behavior not only encroaches upon the original parking space but also increases the operational costs of the bike-sharing companies and adversely impacts the urban image. Fig. 1 presents examples of regulated and unregulated parking of shared bicycles, where the white frame line delineates the electronic fence.

Prior studies on dockless bike-sharing have primarily focused on usage patterns (Chang et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2024; Lei et al., 2024; Nikitas, 2018), reduction of carbon emissions (Cai et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2023), variations in the spatial-temporal distribution and the tidal fluctuations of shared bicycles at parking locations (Han, 2020; Schimohr and Scheiner, 2021), and how shared bikes affect the usage of subways and other public transport (Fan and Zheng, 2020; Hu et al., 2022). However, few studies have addressed the problem of the disorderly parking of shared bicycles. To the best of our knowledge, prior studies on the disorderly parking of shared bicycles can be allocated to two categories: factors affecting regulated parking (e.g., Wang et al., 2023), and initiatives aimed at solving the unorganized parking issue with shared bicycles (e.g., Gao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2021) examined the factors influencing the orderly parking behavior of bike-sharing users based on both norm activation theory and social norm theory. Their results indicate that both individual factors and social environmental factors affect the willingness of customers to park bicycles orderly. Furthermore, cultural tightness-looseness moderates the effect of descriptive social norms on attitudes towards orderly parking. Pasca et al. (2021) conducted a study in Italy exploring the role of gamification mechanisms in improving service quality and loyalty in a bike-sharing system. Such tools influence users' perception of service quality and promote desirable behaviors such as parking in designated areas and reporting damaged bikes. Su et al. (2020) used a randomized field experiment to assess the impact of social norms, warning messages, and monetary incentives on orderly shared bicycle parking. These studies provide an in-depth analysis of the current development and usage patterns of dockless bike-sharing, offering valuable insights into the operation of urban bike-sharing systems. Notably, most of these studies have focused on how to ensure that shared bicycles are parked within defined areas (i.e., within electronic fences), without considering the issue of the orderliness of such parking.

Unregulated parking behaviors generate negative externalities, such as obstructing public pathways, impacting the image of the city, escalating traffic safety risks, and causing wastage and inefficiency of shared bicycle resources as well as inconvenience to subsequent users. Prior research has found that consumer behavior can be constrained by two opposing means: rewarding compliance or penalizing non-compliance (Balliet et al., 2011). Through online laboratory experiments, Tian et al. (2022), compared the effects of penalties and rewards in traffic demand management on congestion during peak travel times. Their results showed that both punishments and rewards can effectively alleviate traffic congestion and promote sustainable travel behaviors, despite differing applicability and long-term effects. Li et al. (2023) found that the effects of government environmental incentives and penalties are different, suggesting the need for targeted formulation of reward policies while also strengthening regulation. Nonetheless, few studies have examined the effects of penalties and rewards on user behavior in the context of dockless bike-sharing.

Drawing on insights from the above studies, this study employs both economic incentives and penalties as interventions to examine their effects on user compliance with the orderly parking of shared bicycles within designated electronic fences. Furthermore, the mediating effects of perceived value and perceived risk in the relationship between economic incentives and penalties and users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles were explored. The moderating impact of various user travel scenarios in this context was also examined.

The contributions of this study are threefold. (1) This study further expands the requirements for the regulated parking of shared bicycles within the areas of electronic fences. The findings contribute to reducing the costs associated with the dispatching and positioning of bicycles for shared bicycle companies, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and improving the urban image. (2) To date, few studies have compared the effects of punishment versus reward on the regulated parking behavior of shared bicycles. This study contributes to the development of the behavioral incentives literature by exploring the extent to which both rewards and punishments influence the willingness to properly park shared bicycles. (3) This paper analyzes user psychology and behavior through online behavioral experiments, enriching the literature on perceived value and perceived risk theories within the scope of normative user behavior. The present research provides empirical evidence that can assist shared bicycle companies in formulating diverse strategies to govern parking conduct throughout various intervals. The findings offer fresh insights for businesses seeking to standardize user behavior, ensuring that businesses can maintain high standards of service while promoting responsible user conduct.

## 2. Literature review and hypotheses development

### 2.1. Economic incentives and users' willingness to properly park shared bicycles

Incentives work by stimulating the motivation of individuals to complete a certain task, and thus is a way to align individual behaviors with organizational objectives (Lazear, 2000). Scholars commonly use economic incentives as a measure in research on topics such as waste recycling, environmental conservation, and energy conservation. Owusu et al. (2013) examined the willingness of urban households in Ghana to participate in the source separation of solid waste under economic incentive measures. They found that ${80}\%$ of participants were willing to participate in return for monetary rewards. Si et al. (2023) found that incentives positively impact the public's willingness to participate in the carbon generalized system of preferences. Incentives such as points malls and carbon trading are appealing and can enhance the perceived value associated with implementing low-carbon behaviors. Liu and Jin (2019) confirmed that financial subsidies for home energy efficiency and storage can effectively promote low-carbon practices in homes, demonstrating the efficacy of economic incentives in advancing low-carbon initiatives among residents. In the transportation sector, economic incentives are often used to encourage carpooling services. Countries like Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have developed policies to encourage carpooling. Carpooling companies encourage consumers to use and continue to use carpooling services by offering point incentives and discounts (Si et al., 2023; Si et al., 2022).

Research on environmental conservation and recycling behaviors generally focuses on how individuals can mitigate their adverse impacts on the environment through daily practices. Proper usage and parking of shared bicycles reflect both the responsible use of public resources and an active participation in environmental protection. Consequently, this issue is highly similar to environmental protection and recycling behaviors. From a bike-sharing perspective, incentive measures represented by cash rewards have a positive effect on improving user behavior. Wang and Wang (2021) showed that pick-up incentive, drop-off incentive, and two-stage incentive mechanisms all help to rebalance the free-floating system of shared bikes, where users are incentivized at both pick-up and drop-off steps. The increase in the incentive budget has made the change more significant, but the pace has gradually slowed. Specifically, incentive measures at the departure point and destination can help operators balance the spatial distribution of shared bicycles. The provision of cash and free discounts for the next ride are two popular types of incentives among users (Fukushige et al., 2022). Currently, Meituan Bicycles has set regular rewards for users who ride shared bicycles out of the vehicle silting point. Hellobike considers reducing riding fees for users who park shared bicycles in high-demand areas (NCNA, 2023). Economic incentives can enhance the benefits user receive for standardized parking of shared bicycles. Therefore, the appropriate provision of financial incentives can motivate adherence to parking norms. Based on the above analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H1. Economic incentives have a significant positive impact on users' willingness to properly park shared bicycles.

### 2.2. Punitive measures in relation to users' willingness to properly park shared bicycles

Punishment has been shown to be an effective way to reduce selfish behaviors (Nikiforakis, 2008). The non-standard parking of shared bikes has negative effects and the punishment mechanism can be effective in reducing such behaviors. For example, the establishment of a detour punishment mechanism related to shared carpooling services, where the collected fees are utilized to promote sustainable travel, can effectively encourage carpooling behavior (Young et al., 2020). Similarly, punishment mechanisms can also aid in the recycling of household waste, provided that a diverse range of reward and penalty strategies is formulated (Zhang et al., 2022).

Although prior studies have found that stringent punishments can produce immediate effects, the best results can only be achieved by adjusting the punishment level to a meaningful intensity. Currently, shared bicycle companies employ punitive measures such as point deductions and adding offenders to a restricted riding "blacklist". In Guangzhou, China, users receive a warning for their first parking infraction, which is followed by a vehicle dispatch fee ranging from 2 to 20 Yuan for subsequent violations (Sohu, 2023). In February 2022, Beijing implemented the "Beijing Regional Internet Rental Bicycle Industry Normative User Parking Behavior Joint Restrictive Covenant". By December 2023, nearly 860 individuals were added to the "Beijing illegal parking and joint restricted riding list" (BJCTC, 2024). Punishment, therefore, serves as a selective method of sanctioning poor behavioral choices, thus effectively altering individual actions and guiding the public to behave according to expectation by the government. Based on the above analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H2. Punitive measures have a significant positive impact on users' willingness to park shared bicycles in a compliant manner.

#### 2.3.The mediating roles of perceived value and perceived risk

Perceived value is a precursor to behavioral intentions (Cronin et al., 2000). It consists of the comprehensive analysis of the value of a product or service by the customer and the subsequent evaluation or selection decision. This concept was first proposed by Zeithaml (1988). The theory of perceived value has mostly been used to study consumer behaviors (Laukkanen and Tura, 2022; Granato et al., 2022) and individual willingness (Nguyen et al., 2022). In online shopping, the information displayed on the shopping details page, such as product performance and quality, affects consumers' perceived value, leading them to prefer purchasing products they perceive as having higher value. Perceived value thus has a significant positive impact on consumers' online purchase intention (Wu et al., 2014).

In the field of public transportation, perceived value is associated with users' perception of the benefits obtained by using services (Nguyen et al., 2022). The enhancement of perceived value may be related to consumer expectations. When recognizing that orderly parking of shared bicycles benefits others and society overall, individuals are more likely to engage in orderly parking behaviors. The measurement of perceived value may be affected by individual endogenous biases (Sun et al., 2022). Users who perceive bike-sharing as a low-cost alternative to get around may have a higher perceived value for economic incentives. Similarly, the willingness to park shared bicycles properly is amplified if users perceive this practice as aligning with their personal beliefs and values. When shared bicycle companies offer economic incentives for proper parking, they instill a higher intrinsic value in the behavior. Consequently, users' willingness to regulate their parking may also increase. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H3. Perceived value plays a mediating role between economic incentives and users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles.

Perceived risk encompasses the uncertainty of decision outcomes and the severity of consequences resulting from erroneous decisions (Cunningham, 1967). The risk perceived by individuals primarily emanates from two sources: objective or measurable risks, and subjective risks shaped by the priorities of individuals (Xia, 2022). Perceived risk significantly influences consumer attitudes by impacting consumer trust in products or services (Zhang et al., 2019). Perceived risk can impact individual behaviors, as those who perceive higher risk are more likely to act compared to those who perceive lower risk (Karimi and Ataei, 2023). Punitive measures have a greater deterrent effect on those who overestimate the severity of penalties, as they perceive non-compliance as a higher-risk behavior (Truelove et al., 2021).

Most users may not be aware that the placement of shared bicycles within designated parking areas is a matter of concern. Fines for improper parking behavior will greatly increase the cost associated with the use of shared bicycles, potentially leading to substantial user attrition. As a credit-based rental service, shared bicycles require a robust social credit system (Li et al., 2023). The evolution of the sharing economy has catalyzed the emergence of third-party credit agencies, such as Sesame Credit, which have become integral to shared services (Gu, 2022). Notably, Sesame Credit contributes technical support to the construction of shared bicycle credit systems. For example, since 2017, Hellobike has provided a deposit-free service for users with Sesame Credit scores exceeding 650 points (Zhao et al., 2023). In light of the impact of fines on user convenience and the likelihood of reusing shared bicycles, this study did not choose fines as a punitive measure. Instead, individuals in this study faced point penalties for the improper parking of shared bicycles. Considering the adverse consequences of erroneous decisions, users may thus be more inclined to park shared bicycles properly. Based on the above analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H4. Perceived risk plays a mediating role between punitive measures and users' willingness to regulate their parking behavior of shared bicycles.

#### 2.4.The regulating effect of the travel scenarios

Bicycle sharing provides a convenient mode of transport for city dwellers during peak commuting hours in the morning and evening. With the improvement in living standards and the increase in leisure and entertainment activities, residents also choose to use shared bicycles for short-distance recreational activities (Meng et al., 2023). This study divided travel scenarios into two categories — commuting and non-commuting travel - that differ in aspects such as mode of transportation, travel time, purpose, and distance (Yang et al., 2020). Mirzaei et al. (2021) found that non-work travel is more affected by relative humidity and temperature than work-related travel. Residents generally prefer living in areas that reduce commuting distances. Differences exist in cycling distances and durations among tourist cyclists, leisure cyclists, and commuter cyclists (Guo et al., 2013). These differences between commuting and non-commuting cycling can be attributed to factors such as personal health, socioeconomic status, and environmental considerations (Porter et al., 2020).

The purpose, characteristics, and distances associated with commuting and non-commuting travel substantially influence user behavior. Time pressure can influence human behavior and the capacity to make accurate decisions. During commuting periods, residents typically experience time pressure when utilizing shared bicycles (Cœugnet et al., 2019). With increasing walking time from the parking location to the destination, the probability that users will choose to park their shared bicycles in the designated location will gradually decrease. Conversely, with decreasing user sensitivity to travel time, the probability that they park shared bicycles at designated points will gradually increase. Commuting travel, as opposed to non-commuting travel, typically exhibits a higher sensitivity to time. However, parking shared bicycles properly within designated areas requires both time and effort. When commuting, users will weigh the time cost against the risk associated with improperly parking shared bicycles. Consequently, the travel scenarios will, to a certain extent, affect the user's willingness to park their shared bicycles in a standardized manner. Based on the above analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed.

H5. The travel scenarios play a moderating role in the influence of economic incentives on users’ willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles.

H6. The travel scenarios play a moderating role in the impact of punishment measures on users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles.

Based on the development and analysis presented above, the theoretical framework of this study is illustrated in Fig. 2.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Sample data

This study used an online experimental approach to simulate experimental situations, thereby minimizing biases caused by participants' subjective factors. Data were collected through the data marketplace of the online survey platform "Credamo" (https:// www.credamo.com). Each participant received monetary compensation of 5RMB (approximately 0.68 USD). Credamo offers a one-stop solution for questionnaire design, participant response management, reward distribution, data verification, and statistical modeling. It is capable of completing questionnaire design, online participant response and reward payments, data inspection and statistical modeling. The quality of the data obtained from this platform is high, and thus, Credamo has been used in many previous studies (Zhao et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).

### 3.2. Experimental design

The experiment comprised two parts. The first part obtained demographic information such as gender, age, education, and occupation. The second part included specialized items such as perceived value, perceived risk, and the willingness of users to park shared bicycles in compliance with norms. The experimental context was established as users preparing to return shared bicycles using a mobile app after completing their ride. Users were required to read the information provided by the shared bicycle company and decide whether they will park shared bicycles in a regulated manner.

Upon commencing the experiment, participants first had to read the following experimental instructions: "To regulate the parking behavior of shared bicycle users, the government and shared bicycle companies have collaborated to develop an 'electronic fence' (within the white line,which is the $P$ spot displayed on the bike-sharing app). Users can only complete locking and stop monetary charges by parking the shared bicycle correctly within the area of the 'electronic fence'. In this questionnaire, the regulated parking of shared bicycles is defined as the parking of the shared bicycle in an orderly and neat fashion in the designated parking area. Any behavior of parking the shared bicycle outside of the specified area, horizontally, in reverse, tilted, or stacked are all considered to be non-standard parking behaviors." Subsequently, participants were asked about the frequency of their shared bicycle usage. Only users with a stated frequency of bike-sharing use of an average of 1-2 times per month or more were able to move on to the next round of responses. The selected participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups, asked to read the text materials, and required to make choices. The study consisted of two experiments, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, a single-factor, three-level (economic incentive, penalty measures, or control) between-groups design was used. Experiment 1 aimed to examine the impacts and differences of economic incentives and penalties on users' willingness to comply with shared bicycle parking regulations and to explore the mediating roles of perceived value and perceived risk in this context. In Experiment 2,a 2 (economic incentive vs. penalty measures) $\times  2$ (commuting vs. non-commuting travel) experimental framework was used. The purpose was to examine the moderating effect of travel scenarios. Fig. 3 provides a detailed presentation of the experimental grouping and experimental procedures.

This study used coupon and point rewards as economic incentive measures. The underlying rationale is that the implementation of economic incentives in the public sector can effectively alter travel behaviors, and coupon distribution is the most common form of economic incentives (Azhdar and Nazemi, 2020). Both the direct receipt of coupons and the accumulation of points that can be exchanged for coupons are recognized as effective economic incentive methods. Bike sharing companies in Italy have introduced incentives to reward users who report improperly parked bikes and park them in designated areas. Users can earn points for these actions, which can be redeemed for ride credits or supermarket discounts (Pasca et al., 2021). Currently, some shared bicycle firms impose a $5\mathrm{{RMB}}$ vehicle scheduling fee on users who fail to park bicycles at designated parking spots,but this approach has led to significant user attrition. Credit scoring can mitigate user-company friction (Stein, 2002). Compared to direct financial penalties, the deduction of points represents a relatively milder approach, as it does not impose an immediate economic burden on the users. Hence, point deduction from the platform and credit score deduction were selected as punitive measures. The travel scenarios in this study include commuting travel and non-commuting travel. Commuting involves the use of shared bicycles during morning and evening peak hours, while non-commuting travel refers to the use of shared bicycles during off-peak times for activities such as socializing, entertainment, and leisure. The measurement items used in the experiment were adapted from studies in related fields, with only minor modifications in wording. Table 1 details these specific items and their reference sources. A 7-point Likert scale evaluation was used, where higher scores indicate higher levels of agreement or compliance.

### 3.3. Descriptive statistics

This study involved a total of 1,081 participants who completed the questionnaire, these respondents were all from mainland China. During the initial screening phase, 241 individuals were excluded because of their infrequent use of shared bicycles. Further examination of the participants' response times and patterns led to the exclusion of 31 individuals from the study (i.e., those whose response times were too-short or too-long, or who provided identical responses to all questions). Consequently, a total of 809 valid responses were obtained for analysis (see Table 2 for a sample description). Of the respondents who provided valid questionnaires, 42.3 % were male and 57.7 % were female. The share of female participants was above the average, yet remained within an acceptable range. In terms of age distribution, respondents aged 26-35 constituted the largest group, accounting for 51.4%, and thus the dataset predominantly represented the younger demographic. A majority of respondents had an undergraduate education. The largest occupational group among respondents was corporate employees. A majority of respondents were middle to high-income earners, exhibiting a balanced distribution in monthly income. With regard to the user demographics of shared bicycles, most studies have concluded that groups with higher educational levels and younger individuals show a higher inclination to use shared bicycles for travel (Vogel et al., 2014). This finding is similar to the proportions of the respondents in this experiment.

After reading the definition of regulated parking of shared bicycles, 29.1% of respondents admitted to having previously engaged in non-standard parking practices. Of this subgroup, 184 individuals conceded to parking bicycles horizontally and 213 admitted to reverse parking. The most common violation was parking at an angle, which was admitted by 303 respondents. Additionally, 21.9 % of respondents admitted to not having parked their shared bicycles in designated areas, a smaller share than those who engaged in nonstandard parking within these areas. This finding indicates that the implementation of electronic fences has partially regularized user parking behavior for shared bicycles. However, merely designating standard parking zones has not fully addressed the root of nonstandard parking habits. To date, none of the shared bicycle companies has implemented standardized measures to manage user behavior in electronic fences. This experiment focuses on exploring these aspects in greater detail.

## 4. Results

The Cronbach's alpha of the economic incentive scale was 0.61, that of the perceived value scale was 0.57 , that of the punishment measure scale was 0.51, that of the perceived risk scale was 0.77 , and that of the user's willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles was 0.60. According to Hinton (2014), when Cronbach's alpha values range between 0.5 and 0.7, the model has moderate reliability. For each dimension, Cronbach's alpha values exceeded 0.5 , indicating a decent reliability of the questionnaire. The Harman single-factor test (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) was used to test for common method bias. The seven factors in the principal component factor explained ${62.2}\%$ of the total variation. The first factor accounted for ${16.6}\%$ of the total variation,this is below ${40}\%$ ,suggesting that there is no significant common method bias in the research data.

#### 4.1.The influence of economic incentives and punishment measures on users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles

The influence of economic incentives on users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly was assessed using an independent sample $t$ -test. The results indicate that among users in the economic incentive group,the willingness to park correctly $(\mathrm{M} = {6.069},\mathrm{\;{SD}} =$ 0.531) was significantly higher than that of the control group (M = 5.653,SD = 0.845),Cohen’s d = 0.704,t (221) = 4.827,p < 0.001, $\mathrm{d} = {0.493},{95}\% \mathrm{{CI}}\left\lbrack  {{0.246},{0.857}}\right\rbrack$ ,thus confirming $\mathrm{H}1$ . Similarly,the impact of punishment measures on users’ willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles was also verified through independent sample $t$ -test. The findings demonstrate that in the punitive measures group,the willingness to park correctly $(\mathrm{M} = {6.116},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.514})$ was significantly higher than in the control group $(\mathrm{M} =$ ${5.653},\mathrm{\;{SD}} = {0.845})$ ,Cohen’s d $= {0.696},\mathrm{\;p} < {0.001},\mathrm{t}\left( {216}\right)  = {5.429},{95}\% \mathrm{{Cl}}\left\lbrack  {{0.295},{0.632}}\right\rbrack$ ,thus supporting $\mathrm{H}2$ . Moreover,the willingness of users to properly park shared bicycles was not significantly different between the economic incentives group $(\mathrm{M} =$ 6.069,SD $= {0.531}$ ) and the punishment measures group $\left( {\mathrm{M} = {6.116},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.514}}\right)$ ,Cohen’s $\mathrm{d} = {0.522}$ ,t $\left( {272}\right)  =  - {0.742},\mathrm{p} > {0.05},\mathrm{d} =$ -0.088, 95% CI [-0.171, 0.077]. However, the willingness of users in the punishment measures group was slightly higher than that of those in the economic incentives group.

Subsequently, the willingness to properly park shared bicycles was compared across genders and age groups. Gender was classified as male and female and was self-reported by participants. Age groups were divided into a young group (35 years old and below) and an older group (36 years old and above). The results indicate that the difference between males (M $= {5.990},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.666}$ ) and females (M $=$ 5.937, SD $= {0.579}$ ) in the willingness to park shared bicycles properly was not significant. Given the inequality of variance between the data for both age groups,the data were analyzed using a $t$ -test assuming unequal variances. The results showed that the willingness of the older age group to park shared bicycles properly $\left( {\mathrm{M} = {6.115},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.458}}\right)$ was significantly higher than that of the younger age group $\left( {\mathrm{M} = {5.927},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.641}}\right) ,\mathrm{p} < {0.001},\mathrm{t} =  - {3.268}$ . The results of the data analysis are shown in Table 3.

### 4.2. Mediating effects test

#### 4.2.1. Mediating role of perceived value

Hayes' PROCESS program (Model 4) was chosen to examine the mediating effect of perceived value through a bootstrap procedure with a sample size of 5000 and a 95% confidence interval (see Table 4). This method was chosen because bootstrap is a nonparametric resampling procedure that repeatedly samples from the data set and estimates indirect effects in each resampled data set. This procedure can be used to test for mediation that does not enforce the assumption of normality of the sample distribution (Preacher and Hayes, 2004; 2008). The results indicate that economic incentives could significantly positively predict users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles (t = 6.851, p < 0.05), thereby reaffirming H1. When both economic incentives and perceived value were entered into the regression equation,both economic incentives $\left( {\mathrm{t} = {2.020},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ and perceived value $\left( {\mathrm{t} = {4.996},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ could significantly and positively affect users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles. The total effect of economic incentives and perceived value on users' willingness to regulate the parking of shared bikes was 0.490 . The direct effect of economic incentives was 0.182 . The mediating effect of the perceived value between economic incentives and willingness to regulate parking was 0.308 , with a confidence interval of [0.172, 0.473]. Thus, perceived value is confirmed to act as a mediator between economic incentives and correct parking willingness, validating H3.

#### 4.2.2. Mediating role of perceived risk

A bootstrap procedure was also employed to examine the mediating effect of perceived risk, with a selected sample size of 5000 and a 95% confidence interval (see Table 5). The results showed that punitive measures could significantly and positively predict users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles $\left( {\mathrm{t} = {4.781},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ ,which again verifies $\mathrm{H}2$ . When both punitive measures and perceived risk were entered into the regression equation,perceived risk $\left( {\mathrm{t} = {4.012},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ significantly and positively affected users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles. The total effect of punitive measures and perceived risk on users' willingness to regulate their parking behavior of shared bicycles was 0.325 , and the direct effect of punitive measures was 0.212 . The mediating effect of perceived risk between punitive measures and willingness to regulate parking was 0.113 , and the confidence interval was $\left\lbrack  {{0.050},{0.207}}\right\rbrack$ . Thus,perceived risk was found to mediate the relationship between punitive measures and the willingness to park correctly, which confirm H4.

### 4.3. Moderating effect of the travel scenarios

Regression analysis was used to examine whether the effects of financial incentives and penalties on users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles were moderated by travel scenarios. The data from Experiment 2 were analyzed using the Process plug-in of SPSS,selecting Model 1. Travel scenarios were coded as a binary categorical variable (commuting travel scenarios $= 0$ ,non-commuting travel scenarios $= 1$ ). Economic incentives were chosen as independent variable,user willingness to regulate parking was chosen as dependent variable, and travel scenarios were chosen as moderator to analyze moderating effects. The results showed that the main effect of economic incentives on the intention to park shared bicycles properly was significant (F $=$ 38.35,p $< {0.05}$ ). However, the interaction effect between economic incentives and travel scenarios was not significant (F = 0.543, p = 0.462 > 0.05). This result suggests that travel scenarios did not significantly change the effect of economic incentives on users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles. Thus, H5 is not supported.

The same method was chosen to examine the moderating role of perceived risk between punitive measures and users' willingness to regulate their parking behavior of shared bicycles. Punitive measures were treated as independent variables, users' willingness to standardize the parking of shared bicycles was treated as dependent variable, and travel scenarios were treated as moderating variables. Whether the interaction effect of punitive measures and traveling scenarios is significant was also examined. The main effect of punitive measures on users’ intention to park shared bicycles properly was significant $\left( {\mathrm{F} = {28.67},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ ,and the interaction effect between punitive measures and travel scenarios was also significant $\left( {\mathrm{F} = {4.99},\mathrm{p} = {0.027} < {0.05}}\right)$ . Through further effect analysis,it was found that subjects’ willingness to regulate their parking in the commuting travel scenarios $\left( {\mathrm{M} = {5.863},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.501}}\right)$ ,differed significantly from that in the non-commuting travel scenarios $\left( {\mathrm{M} = {6.117},\mathrm{{SD}} = {0.452}}\right) ,\mathrm{t}\left( {195}\right)  =  - {3.736},\mathrm{p} < {0.05}$ . Therefore,travel scenarios acted as a moderator in the influence of punitive measures on the intention to park properly,thus confirming H6. To reflect the moderating effect of travel scenarios more intuitively,punitive measures were classified into high $\left( {\mathrm{M} + 1\mathrm{{SD}}}\right)$ and low(M - 1SD) levels. Differences in users' intentions to properly park shared bicycles under commuting and non-commuting scenarios are shown in Fig. 4. Specifically, punitive measures had a significantly greater impact on the intention to park properly under non-commuting scenarios compared to commuting scenarios.

## 5. Discussion and implications

### 5.1. Discussion

This paper used an online behavioral experiment to empirically examine the mechanisms by which economic incentives and penalties affect users' intentions to park shared bicycles properly. The results indicate that both economic incentives and punitive measures had a significant positive impact on users' intentions to park shared bicycles properly, which is in agreement with the findings of Xiao et al. (2022) and Petrunoff et al. (2015). The effect of punitive measures was slightly stronger than that of economic incentives, which is consistent with the findings of Wang and Huo (2023) but inconsistent with those of Gamma et al. (2021). The possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows. Firstly, the participants may have been influenced by the specific cultural context of China, which may have influenced their responses to incentives and penalties. In cultures where social norms strongly emphasize rule compliance and collective responsibility, individuals may be more responsive to penalties designed to enforce proper behavior (Asgari Toorzani and Rassafi, 2022; Yuniaristanto et al., 2024). Secondly, the theory of operant conditioning holds that behavior is driven by its consequences, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are all methods that attempt to control behavior (Altman et al., 1985). Rewards evoke emotions such as happiness, thus fostering positive reinforcement. Deductions in platform points and credit scores as a form of punishment make users feel a loss of personal benefits when they park improperly, leading to the opposite behavior. Both methods significantly enhance the intention to park properly. Thirdly, individuals generally prioritize loss avoidance over the pursuit of gains (Steinel et al., 2022). According to the theory of loss aversion, the sorrow induced by the loss of credit is more intense than the happiness derived from monetary rewards (Zhang & Li, 2020). Thus, users are more sensitive to punishments associated with improper parking than to rewards received for proper parking. Fourthly, the incentives provided in this experiment included coupons and point rewards, while punishments consisted of deductions in corporate points and credit scores. Users were eager to exchange the standardized parking of shared bicycles for economic incentives, and they also did not want to be punished for irregular parking. Given that punishments are tied to the credit of users, credits can influence the ease of use associated with shared bicycles. Therefore, the effect of punishment was slightly stronger than that of economic rewards. However, no significant difference was found in the impact of either on users' intention to park shared bicycles properly.

Mediating effect analysis showed that economic incentives increased the perceived value of orderly parking for users. This increase in perceived value significantly increased users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles. Perceived value mediated between economic incentives and users' intention to park properly. Similarly, punitive measures increased the perceived risk associated with improper parking. This increase in perceived risk significantly and positively influenced users’ intention to park properly. Perceived risk thus serves as a mediator between punitive measures and the users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly. These findings are consistent with the results of Nguyen-Phuoc et al. (2022).

Travel scenarios significantly moderated the effect of penalties on users' willingness to properly park shared bicycles. Users are known to exhibit different psychological characteristics in commuting versus non-commuting scenarios, with heightened sensitivity to time changes in commuting contexts (Poudel and Singleton, 2022). The results of this study confirm this phenomenon. In the context of penalizing the irregular parking of shared bicycles, users exhibited a higher willingness to park properly in non-commuting scenarios compared to commuting scenarios. In non-commuting scenarios, users have sufficient time and are thus more likely to park their bicycles properly in designated areas, thus showing a higher inclination to follow parking norms to avoid penalties. However, the hypothesis that travel scenarios moderate the effect of economic incentives on the intention to park shared bicycles properly was not supported. This result may be because, in the context of economic incentives, users' interests are not harmed when they engage in irregular bicycle parking behavior. Proper parking of shared bicycles requires both time and experience. Users' willingness to regulate their parking is less affected by travel scenarios, resulting in a less significant moderating effect.

### 5.2. Theoretical implications

This study provides several theoretical implications for the literature. First, research on the standardized parking of shared bicycles is supplemented. Prior studies have primarily addressed the parking of shared bicycles in designated areas, while neglecting issues related to parking in prohibited areas such as sidewalks and green belts. Less attention has been directed to the problem of the orderliness of the placement of shared bicycles within designated parking areas. This research broadens the scope of research on standardized parking by including the issue of orderly placement of shared bicycles within geofenced areas. This study finds that both economic incentives and punitive measures significantly increase users' compliance with the proper parking of shared bicycles, thus addressing a research gap on shared bicycle parking.

Second, this study enriches the research related to theories of perceived value and perceived risk. Economic incentives affect people's willingness to regulate their bicycle parking behavior by increasing the perceived value of doing so. Punitive measures increase users' perceived risk, thus affecting their inclination to comply with parking norms. The findings of this study suggest that increasing users' perceived value and perceived risk can change their behavior in ways desired by governments and businesses. This finding can inspire new studies, such as how to best guide people to behave in accordance with other expectations.

Third, this study reveals the moderating effect of travel scenarios. To date, few studies have focused on the effects of travel scenarios on the behavior of users. This study shows that, in the context of commuting, punitive measures significantly influence users' willingness to park shared bicycles in a regulated manner, more so than under non-commuting scenarios. This result further delineates the specific conditions and limiting factors for the efficiency of punitive measures.

### 5.3. Practical implications

As both the deployment of dockless shared bicycles and the number of daily active users increase, the question of how to encourage more users to park these bicycles in a regulated manner becomes a critical issue demanding the attention of bike-sharing companies. Knowing when and where to take specific measures to regulate user behavior is a prerequisite for the formulation of relevant policies and procedures. This study provides insights for bike-sharing companies to formulate such strategies.

First, shared bicycle companies should make adept use of reward measures. This study found that specific economic incentives can effectively increase users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly. Issuing coupons, free riding passes, or a combination of these can regulate user behavior and effectively enhance their willingness to comply with parking norms. For bike-sharing companies, adopting economic incentives may reduce the company's revenue in the short term. However, it can also reduce the labor costs of offline scheduling and maintenance of shared bicycles for companies, as most users have already adopted standardized parking practices for shared bicycles. Such adoption of economic incentives can also reduce the labor cost associated with operating and maintaining the offline aspect of bike-sharing.

Second, bike-sharing companies can adopt punitive measures to regulate users' parking behavior. For example, deducting credit points from users who improperly park shared bicycles. The first deduction would not affect the user's subsequent use, providing an opportunity for behavioral correction. Repeated instances of irregular parking behavior will negatively affect the user's future use, forcing them to regulate their parking behavior. Bike-sharing companies should refine their scoring mechanism (for example by using Sesame Credit), establish comprehensive parking regulations, and set clear standards for proper bicycle parking. For shared bike users, although the proper parking of bikes increases the difficulty associated with parking, neatly arranged bikes within designated areas facilitate their subsequent use.

Third, when formulating economic incentives, bike-sharing companies should focus on enhancing users’ perceived value. Compared with propaganda, economic incentives are more effective in enhancing perceived value among the public. When both monetary and non-monetary incentives are adopted, it is crucial to enhance users' perceived value of provided incentives. For example, in the interface of the app customers use when parking their shared bicycles, the value of incentives can be emphasized by pop-up reminders, thus enhancing the perceived value of users as much as possible. When implementing punitive measures against users for the improper parking of shared bicycles, it is crucial to consider users' perceived risk. In this context, it is important to raise users' risk awareness without overstating risk. As non-commuting travel scenarios positively influence users' willingness to park properly, shared bicycle companies can take different strategies to regulate the user's parking behavior at different times of the day. During weekdays and peak travel times in the morning and evening, punitive measures should be implemented for improper parking. On weekends and during off-peak hours, economic rewards could be used instead to incentivize proper parking. These approaches aim to increase users' willingness to park shared bikes correctly while minimizing customer attrition.

## 6. Conclusions

In this paper, perceived value and perceived risk were introduced as mediating variables in online behavioral experiments to explore the influence mechanism of economic incentives and punitive measures on users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly. The results of regression analysis and bootstrap analysis show that both economic incentives and punitive measures significantly enhanced the willingness of users to park shared bikes correctly, and the effect of punitive measures was slightly better than that of economic incentives. Perceived value played a mediating role between economic incentives and users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly. Perceived risk acted as a mediator between punitive measures and users' willingness to park shared bicycles properly. When penalizing the irregular parking of shared bicycles, users' willingness to park bicycles properly was significantly higher under non-commuting scenarios than under commuting scenarios. Based on the empirical results, relevant policy recommendations were proposed to regulate users' parking behavior accordingly.

Although this study draws meaningful conclusions, certain limitations need to be noted and addressed in future research. Firstly, culture may be an important factor influencing the parking behavior of bicycle sharing users. Because the level of development of bicycle sharing infrastructure and the frequency of use vary greatly between countries, research on the willingness to properly park bicycles in other countries was not included in this study. Cultural factors will be incorporated in future research to explore the differences in users' willingness to regulate the parking of shared bicycles under different cultural contexts. Secondly, in this study, commuting and non-commuting travel scenarios were considered and their moderating effects were explored. However, for travel scenarios, the number of bicycles already parked in the parking area was not considered. This may be an important factor influencing users' willingness to regulate the parking of shared bicycles. The number of existing shared bikes in a parking area will likely determine both whether there are still enough spots in that area to park shared bikes properly, and how neatly the shared bikes already present in this area are placed will likely influence subsequent user behavior. This issue will be explored in future research. Thirdly, in practice, users pay to use shared bicycles and may not consider it their responsibility to keep the parking area organized. User personality may also be an important factor influencing their parking behavior. Future research should therefore consider the variables of user responsibility and user personality to explore whether these factors influence parking behavior. Fourthly, this experiment adopted an online experiment to study the changes in users' willingness to regulate their parking of shared bicycles under economic incentives and penalties and their influencing factors. However, the willingness of users does not necessarily translate into their actual behavior. Future research should therefore explore the relationship between users' willingness to park shared bikes properly and their actual parking behavior.
