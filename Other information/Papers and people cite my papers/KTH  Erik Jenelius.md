### Research

[A short film about Jenelius' research.](https://www.kth.se/en/om/mot/akademiska-hogtider/professorsinstallation/2023/erik-jenelius-1.1330465)

Erik Jenelius' research focuses on developing our transport systems towards sustainability, climate neutrality and [resilience](https://www.kth.se/profile/jenelius/page/transport-system-resilience), while also ensuring they are efficient, inclusive, and reliable. Jenelius' work is dedicated to creating a more resource-efficient system that emphasizes collective travel, micro-mobility, and active modes of transport.

A key aspect involves enhancing our understanding of people's travel patterns and needs, a field where automatic data sources like digital ticketing systems, GPS tracking, and mobile apps open new opportunities. Technological advancements also facilitate new forms of systems, such as demand-responsive autonomous vehicles in public transport, which require analysis and design to achieve their full potential.

Other critical areas for Jenelius include addressing crowding in vehicles and at stations, improving punctuality, and increasing resilience to disruptions through planning, traffic management and real-time information.

### Impact

Jenelius collaborates with industry and administration in both research and innovation projects and education. He regularly provides state-of-art knowledge and advice to companies and public actors in his areas of expertise.

Jenelius' research group collaborates with the Region Stockholm Public Transport Administration to develop, implement and apply analysis methods for automated public transport data, especially ticket validations (the Access system), passenger counts, vehicle positions and timetables. [More about the impact of this work.](https://www.kth.se/profile/jenelius/page/travel-pattern-analysis-from-public-transport-smart-cards)

In the course [Public transport systems, buses and rail](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/AH1025?l=en), Erik collaborates with the Region Stockholm Public Transport Administration. Region Stockholm contributes with project assignments and lectures. The Region's involvement provides students with knowledge that they can use in their future working lives. [More about this collaboration.](https://www.kth.se/en/samverkan/partnerskap/nyheter-fran-partner/samarbete-okar-utbildningens-relevans-1.1354942)

Jenelius is part of Swedish Transport Administration's scientific council on passenger transport models, and he is recurrently employed as expert evaluator for international science funding councils. He has participated in [roundtable discussions on transport system resilience](https://itf-oecd.org/transport-system-resilience-roundtable) at OECD International Transport Forum and has represented academia in delegations led by Business Sweden and embassies.

### Teaching

Erik Jenelius is course responsible, teacher and examiner for the Bachelor level course [AH1025 Public Transport Systems, Buses and Rail](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/AH1025?l=en). The course provides a basic knowledge of the condition, design, management and control of a public transportation system. Environmental impact, market, vehicle systems, planning, financing and organization are treated on a general level. He is also course responsible, teacher and examiner for the Master level course [AH2173 Public Transport](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/AH2173?l=en), which covers more advanced aspects of public transport planning, operations, analysis and evaluation.

At the PhD level, Jenelius is course responsible, teacher and examiner for the course [FAF3816 Scientific Engagement in Transport Science](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/FAF3816?l=en). The course is designed to encourage students to participate in a sufficient amount of scientific communication activities, to communicate in oral and written form original research results and their societal implications to others, and to supervise other students in theoretical and/or practical projects.

Jenelius also regularly supervises theses at the Bachelor, Master and PhD levels.
